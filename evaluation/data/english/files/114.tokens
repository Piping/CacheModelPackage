The average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun we ran a survey to find out but hes always on the lookout for new and better arms Hes more than a reader of outdoor articles hes a real hunter and shooter eager to improve his sport Well if youre that kind of sportsman were here to help you Youve probably given a lot of Christmasseason thought to the guns in your rack but its not easy to decide on a new one You still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts youd appreciate most the time to decide on them is now As a Christmas service Ive taken a close look at this years crop of new models Here they are with my comments and judgments Read on take your pick and start dropping those hints First on my own list would be two arms a rifle and a handgun that qualify as new in the strictest sense For me a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesnt constitute a truly new design Such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change armsmaking concepts Bill Rugers longawaited Deerstalker under $110 is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of highvelocity fans its a short light quickhandling fastfiring little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game whitetail Ruger reports that on his recent African safari the little Magnum cartridge was a real work horse Small antelope were generally grassed with one shot and the Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency these are fairly large tough animals The deadliness of the Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me At least five years ago Tom Robinson of Marlin made up an overunder double rifle for me in this caliber using the now defunct Model 90 action in 20gauge size After figuring out how to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact we fired this little 20inchbarrel job on my home range and in Marlins underground test gallery We quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill Ruger in his first experiments Three or four bullets would be placed well in a sixinch bull at 100 yards and then unaccountably one could stray far out of the group Ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet The new jacketed slug in Magnum corrected this But even without jacketed bullets I had enough faith in my double to take it on an openingday deer hunt that first year Within half an hour I jumped a sixpoint buck that hopskipped through a rhododendron thicket and I caught him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards He moved only about 30 feet after the 240grain slug hit him and this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling Three more deer have fallen to this same gun and all were oneshot kills My double was made with standardweight revolver barrels before cutting to revolver length and although it compares well in other respects its considerably heavier than the Deerstalker which only scales about 612 pounds If ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter this is it The Deerstalker points with the ease speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun and its trigger pull is light and sharp The 240grain bullet leaves the muzzle at 1850 fps which gives it all the smash needed at woods ranges With five shots at the immediate command of the hunters trigger finger the gun and load are a deadly combination The second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load the Remington Jet Magnum Center Fire At present its available in one model the fine and familiar Smith & Wesson Magnum revolver about $110 long a topquality handgun among target arms The velocity of this 40grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2460 fps and its the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge with a midrange rise of about an inch over a 100yard range This is a varmint load pure and simple its much too explosive for small edible game It can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers The most intriguing aspect of the S & W Magnum chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard rimfires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers You may therefore convert the gun into a smallgame and plinking arm although the difference in the point of impact Jet vs rimfire can be somewhat disconcerting The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine I tested it in my scoped S & W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun steadily Hunting rifles 61 The fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesnt mean that 1961 didnt see changes in models actions and calibers Aside from the Ruger carbine a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time Here are the brands in alphabetical order and the new models Newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning group of boltaction highpower rifles They have fine FN actions and a betterthanaverage finish on both the metal and the stock wood Barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available and these include the standard bores about $165 plus the Magnums around $170 the latter include the S & H and Shotguntype rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the Magnums except the Stock designs are excellent for use with scopes Colts centerfire 1961 rifles are all made with Sako actions regardless of caliber The have the short action the and the medium action and the Af and the Magnums the long action about $135 for the Standard Coltsman and $200 for the Custom version Previously FN actions were used for the larger cartridges High Standard has introduced a auto the SportKing in two grades field and special less than $45 and just over $45 respectively Its a streamlined rifle fast and wellmade Among Magnum RimFire rifles 1961s lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader around $60 Previously known as Jefferson Arms Kodiak has given this 11shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle Magnum rimfires Marlin has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings The Model 99 under $45 is a lightweight streamlined rimfire auto with a tubular magazine that holds 18 Long Rifles Its extremely accurate for an auto and the test rifle I tried was completely troublefree in functioning The 989 about $40 is an even newer auto this one with a seven or 12shot clip Once again the Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared but this time as a boltaction rifleshotgun combination The bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert tube which is rifled and which surprisingly gives pretty fair accuracy even though its only 312 inches long You can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with shotshells to break the little Targo clay targets A trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets A spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available You can have your choice of a sevenshot repeater the 340TR about $40 or a singleshot the 320TR $10 less The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wingshooting practice but its tougher than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds Theyll travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but its almost impossible to break one after it passes the 35foot mark The combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds right now Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line for 1961 with the addition of the and to the list of Model 725s These are made on special order only in Kodiak grade about $310 with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads they weigh around nine pounds A shortened version of the highly regarded Remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961 This carbine under $140 about $15 more for a deluxe grade has an 1812inch barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last years Model 760 pump with a shortbarrel This design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard Presently the 742C is available in Af The latest versions of the famous Savage Model 99 are the 99 Featherweight about $125 and the 99 Deluxe under $135 which have a toptang safety and improved trigger design The replacement of the slidelock side safety catch will make this leveraction favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate Beginners guns 61 A fresh crop of beginners guns showed up in 1961 and theyre good bets for your Christmas gift list if youre wondering what to get for a youngster The most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 about $20 $5 for a saddle scabbard a leveraction singleshot patterned after the famous Winchester leveraction and featuring the Western look Because of its traditional lines it probably has more kid appeal than any other model The action is a dropblock handling all the standard rimfires Marlins latest is also designed for the beginning shooter although its a fullsized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock This is the Model 122 about $20 its a singleshot boltaction with an automatic safety ie the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the next shot Stock design is excellent and this model is a good first gun Another boys model is the singleshot Remington 514C around $20 which comes with a 21inch barrel and a short 1212inch stock its just right for a boy of 1212 A beginners shotgun has also been introduced this year The singlebarrel Stevens 940Y under $35 is made with a side lever rather than a toptang lever because many youngsters arent strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun and the side lever does indeed open very easily This gun has a 1212inch stock and is available in either 20 or gauge Theres another addition to the Stevens line the pumpaction Model 77 in under $75 which you may or may not consider a kids gun many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too Shotguns 61 Although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market For example a Browning trap version of the Superposed overunder the Broadway from $350 up depending on grade differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end a cushion recoil pad and a barrelwide ventilated rib for fast sighting The Colt line now includes a new scattergun the Standard or Custom Pump Model about $90 and $150 respectively in 12 16 and 20 Firearms International has introduced another import this one from Finland Its the Valmet about $170 a 12gauge overunder very much like the old Remington 32 which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices High Standard has also added two models to its line The Supermatic Trophy prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional features is a 12gauge auto The FliteKing Trophy beginning at just over $85 is a pump gun in 12 or 16 Either model is a very good dollar value Mossbergs latest contribution to the field is the Model 500 from $7350 this is an improved version of the old Model 200 a pumpaction 12gauge shotgun See page 24 for a complete report on it Handguns 61 Aside from the Jet which I coupled with the Deerstalker carbine as one of the years two biggest developments few significant innovations appeared among 1961s handguns
