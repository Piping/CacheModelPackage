Miraculously she found exactly the right statement She began it deliberately so that none of her words would be lost on him I want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord Im well aware that youve got a pedigree as long as my leg and that I dont amount to anything But But it dont matter atall Lord supplied fondly To me youll always be the girl o my dreams an the sweetest flower that grows Beaming idiotically he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her She yanked away from him furiously You shut up Shutt uppp Ive got something to say to you and by God youre going to listen Do you hear me Youre going to listen Lord nodded agreeably He said he wanted very much to listen He knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would be plumb important as well as pleasin to the ear and he didnt want to miss a word of it So would she mind speaking a little louder I think you stink Tom Lord I think youre mean and hateful and stupid and louder Said Joyce Uhhuh So I can hear you while Im checkin the car Looks like we might be in for a speck of trouble He opened the door and got out He waited at the car side for a moment looking down at her expectantly Well Wasnt you goin to say somethin Then helpfully as she merely stared at him in weary silence Maybe you could write it down for me huh Print it in real big letters an I can cipher it out later Aah go on she said Just go the hell on He grinned nodded and walked around to the front of the car Lips pursed mournfully he stared down at its crazily sagging left side Then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots peered into the orderly chaos of axle shock absorber and spring He went prone on his stomach the better to pursue his examination After a time he straightened again brushing the red Permian dust from his hands slapping it from his sixdollar levis and his tailored twentyfivedollar shirt He wore no gun a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country Never hed once told Joyce had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun And he really feels that way she thought Thats really all hes got all he is Just a big pile of selfconfidence in an almost teensy package If I could make myself feel the same way She studied him hopefully yearningly against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis Here in the Godforsaken place the westerly end of nowhere Tom Lord looked almost insignificant almost contemptible He was handsome with his coalblack hair and eyes his finechiseled features But shed known plenty of handsomer guys and conceding his good looks what was there left He wasnt a big man rather on the medium side Neither was he very powerful of build He could move very quickly she knew although he seldom found occasion to do so but he was more wiry than truly strong And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance Just nothing she told herself Just so darned sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone But by gosh I want him and Im going to have him He caught her eye came back around the car with the bootwearer teetering halfmincing walk Why did these yokels still wear boots anyway when most had scarcely sat a horse in years He slid in at her side tucked a cigar into his mouth and politely proffered one to her Oh cut it out Tom She snapped Cant you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute This aint your brand maybe Lord suggested Or maybe you just dont feel like a cigar I feel like getting back to town thats what I feel like Now are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk Might get there faster walkin Lord drawled seein as how I got a busted front spring On the other hand howsomever maybe you wouldnt either I figger its probly a sixtyfivemile walk and I cn maybe get this spring patched up in a couple of hours How with what Theres nothing out here but rattlesnakes Now aint it the truth Lord laughed with secret amusement Not a danged thing but rattlesnakes so I reckon Ill get the boss rattler to help me Tom For Gods sake Looky He pointed cutting her off See that wildcat She saw it then the distant derrick of the wildcat a test well in unexplored country And even with her limited knowledge of such things she knew that the car could be repaired there sufficiently at least to get them back into town A wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency He had to depend on himself since he was invariably miles and hours away from others Well lets get going she said impatiently I She broke off frowning What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you Why I meant what I said Lord declared What else would I mean anyways She looked at him lips compressed Then with a shrug of pretended indifference she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her makeup In his mood it was the best way to handle him that is to show no curiosity whatsoever Otherwise she would be baited into a tantrum teased and provoked until she lost control of herself and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of Tom Lord Vs Joyce Lakewood The car lurched along at a snails crawl the leftfront mudguard banging and scraping against the tire occasionally scraping against the road itself Lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel He seemed very pleased with himself as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned Along with this selfsatisfaction however Joyce sensed a growing tension It poured out of him like an electric current a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his finedrawn body were coiling for action and that that action would be all that he anticipated Joyce had seen him like this once before more than once actually but on one particularly memorable occasion That was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride field boss for the Highlands Oil & Gas Company Tom had been laying for Aaron McBride for a long time just waiting to catch him out of line McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip He had a legitimate reason for wearing it It was payday for Highlands and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields Moreover as long as the weapon was carried openly the sheriffs office had made no previous issue of it So whats this all about He demanded when Lord confronted him Im not the only man in town with a gun or the only one without a permit It was the wrong thing to say By failing to do as he was told instantly to take out a permit or return the gun to his car he had played into Lords hands The trouble was that he had virtually had to protest The deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him So How about it He said Why single me out on this permit deal Well Ill tell you about that Lord told him We aim t be seelective yknow Dont like to bother no one unless we have to which I figger we do in your case Figger we got to be plumb careful with any of you Highlands big shots McBride reddened He himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company but that had nothing to do with him He was an honest man doing a hard job and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable Look Lord he said hoarsely I know youve got a grudge against me and maybe I cant blame you You think that Highlands swindled you and I helped em do it But youre all wrong man Im no lawyer I just do what Im told and uhhuh An that could mean trouble with a fella thats workin for crooks So you get rid of that pistol right now Mister McBride You do that or take you out a permit right now McBride couldnt do either of course Not immediately as the deputy demanded Not without a facesaving respite of at least a few minutes To do so would make his job wellnigh impossible Oilfield workers were a roughtough lot How could he exert authority over them make them toe the line as he had to if he knuckled under to this smalltown clown Ill get around to it a little later he mumbled desperately Just as soon as I go to the bank and huhuh Now Mister McBride said Lord and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field bosss arm It was strictly the deputys game but McBride had gone too far to throw in Now he could only play the last card in what was probably the worlds coldest deck He flung off Lords hand and attempted to push past him inadvertently shoving him into a storefront It was practically the last move that McBride made of his own volition Lord slugged him in the stomach so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine Then as he doubled gasping vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten Lord straightened him with an uppercut A rabbit punch redoubled him And then there was a numbing blow to the heart and another gutflattening blow to the stomach But he couldnt keep up with them No more could he defend himself against them He seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen And he could no longer think of facesaving of honor but only of escape Why hes going to kill me he thought wildly I meant him no harm Ive given willful hurt to no man I was just doing my job just following orders and for that hes going to kill me Beat me to death in front of a hundred people Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it the murder would go unpunished He McBride would be cited as in the wrong and he Lord would go scotfree an officer who had only done his duty though perhaps too energetically McBride staggered into the street flopped sprawling in the stinging dust Fearmaddened fleeing the lengthening shadow of death he scrambled to his feet again He couldnt see he was long past the point of coherent thinking Dimly he heard laughter hoots of derision but he could not read the racket properly He could not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air He hated them too much to understand the people of this isolated lawuntoitself world that was Lords world This he was sure was the way they would act laughing at a dying man laughing as a man was beaten to death And nothing would be done about it Nothing unless Donna Donna his young wife the girl who was both daughter and wife to him Donna was like he was She lived by the rules never compromising never blinded or diverted by circumstance And Donna would When he regained consciousness he was in Lords house in the office of Doctor Lord the deputys deceased father
