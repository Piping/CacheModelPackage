Good old AZ Cap said You know Ive got one of your cars at home As a prominent industrialist you ought to be interested in his nibs support group Isnt his racket down your alley Once it was William thought But not any more A rush of memory swept him back and he forgot Cap How did he start on such a ride to brief glory Simply enough through the inadvertent agency of his brotherinlaw General Hersheys draft and Doc Eddyman and Cap were responsible for his first eminence but Fearless Freddy Bryan could take credit if he cared to and he did for the second time Freddy needed a job having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper financing by Gerry and it was up to Arthur Willis to provide him with one Mr Willis bought Zenith Plastic Products a skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on Long Island engaged in working out government contracts and installed Freddy in an executive position Shortly after Freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas Willis listened patiently and once in a while William was exposed to them at a family gathering he generally heard Freddys suggestions without interest being absorbed by his own prospering concerns Probably Mr Willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren Gerry began to aid Freddy with her father prodded no doubt by Joans open contempt for Freddy and Williams irritating competency Another factor must have been the eventual disposal of Willis fortune she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with Freddy the more likely he was to reward Freddy richly upon his death Whatever the reasons Willis and Bryan started expanding Zenith They acquired another electronics factory a specialized ceramics company an organization that built very experimentally highspeed research calculators Since they were hunting for national defense contracts Adam Herberet a man of surprising resources entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections Feeling his power Freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer Heavy industry slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers attracted him The Allstates Auto Company a mediumsized firm which manufactured fourwheeldrive vehicles and other offroad equipment had recently constructed an overlarge modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism Cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders it was ripe for amalgamation and Freddys instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash and never mind inevitable consequences With Herberets blessing he was convinced that Allstates Wisconsin folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane subassembly tanks missiles or ordnance of some kind At that point William came into the picture Although not much desiring the account he had been appointed advertising head of Zenith Freed of routine by having his own firm and a complaisant partner his work in New York had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure and if he wasnt entirely committed to what he did he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities Mr Willis eager to have him allied with the family wanted advice beyond the confines of his field and William set out on a serious study of the situation including trips to Wisconsin and Washington In the end he said Im not enchanted by the proposition sir I know a guy named Jack Hamrick a very bright young engineer who was with Chrysler and I took him with me to Allstates Its his expert opinion that the plant isnt well suited to what you have in mind The conversion will cost a fortune Besides that Im acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the Air Force I think Adam Herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side Missiles have thrown everything up for grabs and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here The future of manned aircraft is in doubt which affects government procurement and jet transports have revolutionized the airline trade one jet can take the place of three compoundengine planes This means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough Here are a few facts and figures Ive assembled Cant you stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles Willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged Well he said there is Freddy you know And Gerry Freddy is deeply committed to our plans already He assures me he has people to handle the money raising and Ham Richert my lawyer says the legal aspects of the wedding of Zenith and Allstates are no problem I dont like to exhibit the deadly dampening effect of an elderly mans caution Yes I appreciate that I wish you wouldnt tell Freddy Im lukewarm Ive caused him trouble before and hes beginning to resent me If we dont take care the sisters will be entering the fray on opposite sides brandishing their cudgels Which is a frightful prospect Bill Willis laughed One shouldnt mix commercial affairs with patriarchy but in this case I have no choice Let me think about it Im most grateful to you so grateful I wish you were my principal aide instead of Freddy Not to Williams surprise Freddy Adam and Hamilton Richert prevailed allied to them was Gerry devoting much time to swaying her father and Joan dismissed all thought of the project and William was unwilling to interfere further Zenith absorbed Allstates stock transfers were arranged and Freddy became president of the hyphenated combination Through Jack Hamrick William fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for Shoals and Clay He forgot about AZ till unhappily he and Hamrick were proved correct Freddys backing dropped away from him and Mr Willis was forced to make up the deficit Adam beset by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation couldnt deliver from his end The Wisconsin plant turned out to be a white elephant Stock Willis held in abundance fell sharply in value Confronted by a grim future Freddy lost his nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation Once more Willis summoned William You were right he said you and your engineer and Im in something of a bind Freddys solution doesnt appeal to me In addition to other defects Im a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment Will you see if you can help me William spent a long week end closeted with Hamrick His recent experience in motor car advertising a love for cars of themselves the existence of AZs useless Wisconsin setup exposure to exciting conceptions of Hamricks that nobody would buy and the coincidental recent failure of a respected but outdated smallcar manufacturer called Ticonderoga Motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to broach it Initially Hamricks reaction to AZ going into the passenger car market was discouraging He thought the financing the advertising the production of new models the founding of a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult Then he caught fire If AZ could buy Ticonderoga cheaply and use their presses and dies and other equipment if William could hit precisely the right promotion note if the money hurdle was not insurmountable They took nearly a month to investigate marshal statistics and put their arguments down in black and white Taking Hamrick with him William went to Mr Willis He was surprised and dubious but impressed by the engineer and the report Your alternative is breathtaking he said and Im frank in saying a bit mad I wish I was younger and less timid Well I cant resolve this myself Ill have to call in the brain trust Are you willing to run the gantlet I cant guarantee you a sympathetic audience Well be in there swinging William said but in a way sir youve got to decide it yourself You have the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours and besides nobody else is going to have the courage If they follow anyone itll have to be you He paused I should explain theres more here for me than advocating my little dream theres you You mustnt take a fall or publicly back away I hate that Youre youre Arthur Willis Forgive the hearts and flowers theme I rather like the music Willis replied quietly Thank you At the meeting attended by Freddy Richert Herberet and the AZ executive staff with Mr Willis presiding William and Hamrick did indeed run the gantlet From shock and incredulity most of the listeners went on to open resistance and animosity Oh my God Ham Richert said a little child shall lead them Move over General Motors Its absurd Bill Freddy said from a pale face Youre leading Dad down the garden path Your garden God damn it William said I dont enjoy family quarrels Adam said Nor crazy relatives Were here to transact business Cant we put an end to this Arthur Hear me out please William begged Im an advertising hustler I admit but I have to get hot once in a larger sphere Sure Ticonderoga went broke in the lowpriced market bucking the Big Three Their cars werent small enough they didnt have the power they were oldfashioned They tried to sell em on economy and simple merit Weve arrived at an age for romance and snobbery Weve all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age Look what those little European jobs are doing Well woo the consumer with a product not bludgeon him with chromed excess length and weight Lets make it moonlight and the call of far places and a seduction at reasonable rates Ticonderoga folded a few minutes too soon before the tide changed still honest and stupid and the network of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again waiting for us readymade Weve got rid of the steam yachts and Georgian houses and the bloated tooexpensive automobile is next Why not come down smartly in the world in a chic fashion with an AllstatesZenith He swayed them somewhat but the debate raged on Financing emerged as the main obstacle Mr Willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum Nobody will underwrite it Im telling you Freddy said I know what Im talking about in that department Theres plenty of risk money Ham Richert added but not for anything this risky All right William said Well try to swing the deal on that basis If we cant raise the capital were through Nothing has been lost Youre up against it anyhow Why wont you give me a chance A silence fell Heads instinctively turned in Willis direction He smiled at William and slowly rubbed his hands together I feel I must answer the question he said since the onus later if any should fall on me I dont relish recriminations spread broadcast outside my family Im not giving you a chance Bill but availing myself of your generous offer of assistance Good luck to you All the inlaws have got to have their day Adam said and glared at William and Freddy in turn Sweat started out on Williams forehead whether from relief or disquietude he could not tell Across the table Hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled thumb and forefinger Nobody else showed pleasure Spikehaired burly redfaced decked with hornrimmed glasses and an Ivy League suit Jack Hamrick awaited William at the officers club Hello boss he said and grinned I suppose I can never expect to call you General after that Washington episode Im afraid not
