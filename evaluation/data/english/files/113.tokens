Orlando Fla Feb 2 The best 2yearold pacing mile up to date at Ben White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner MainlinerHighland Ellen a member of the Dick Williams stable who was clocked 225 She is owned by Ralph H Kroening Milwaukee Wis who according to the railbirds can feel justly proud of her Other good miles have been by Debonnie Dale FrostDebby Hanover and Prompt Time AdiosOn Time in 22836 Kimberly Gal GalophoneKimberly Hanover 2262 Laguerre Hanover Tar HeelLotus Hanover and Monel Tar HeelMiracle Byrd in 234 Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation good body plenty of heart girth stands straight on his legs on excellent feet and has the smoothest gait This colt is behind most of the other 2yearolds in the Simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them Monel shows improvement with each workout and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races Stardel Stars PrideStarlette Hanover 234 looks quite promising Fury Hanover Hoot MonFay Caper Hoot MonColumbia Hanover and Isaac Hoot MonGoddess Hanover has been working together but have not equalled their best work done some weeks ago Fury and Caper worked in 235 and did it with ease They are two good colts of different type Fury is upstanding and on the rangy side and Caper is more the compact type I have never seen Caper off his feet he seems to know nothing but trot and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so Fury has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground Trackdown TorridMighty Lady has worked a mile in 2333 It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace Then after emasculation he was eased up for a couple of weeks He has thrived on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race horse Thor Hanover AdiosTrustful Hanover is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual with solid rugged conformation good flat bone and excellent feet This colt arrived at the Raceway early last November and immediately was put into harness and linedriven for a few days and then put to cart and broken in very nicely knowing nothing but trot He appeared in the hopples about November 14 was treated for worms on the 18th the latter date being the first time he struck a real pace On December 5 he paced a mile in 55 on the twicearound out in third position all the way This colt has done everything asked of him and done it with ease His best mile to date is 2322 Gamecock Tar HeelTerka Hanover is another promising colt and his best time is 2322 This is one of the besttempered Tar Heels ever at the center The first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff The fourth time in harness he walked off like a gentleman Being blistered for curbs has delayed his work somewhat But up to date he has shown as much as any in the big Simpson stable Hustler Knight DreamTorkin is a playful bay rascal of a colt not the best gaited but he surely can pace and is right there with them and sometimes leading them in the best miles Torrid Freight TorridBreeze On Hal is a very rugged strongmade colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease everything asked of him His best time is around 233 Strongheart AdiosDirect Gal a fairlooking sorrel colt knows nothing but pace and has been right there in the best miles Torrid Adios TorridAdios Molly is not so masculine as most of the colts but I like his type and he certainly is one of the bestgaited pacers on the grounds Blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks he is coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me First Flyer Frisco FlyerCastle Light looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois Stakes His best time is 2332 The colts in Simpsons stable have little if anything on the fillies especially the pacers Justine Hanover Sampson HanoverJustitia Hanover is improving with each workout and paced 2324 weeks ago Mrs Freight Knight DreamMiss Reed shows promise and does it in good form and her best time is about 235 Hoopla Tar HeelHoliday Hanover a filly that wanted to trot knocked herself October 31 and November 1 fighting the hopples She was then trained on the trot until December 29 hitched to a breaking cart once around the halfmile track and hoppled again This time she submitted and in a few days was going good On January 11 she paced a mile in 243138 on Jan 18 2373361 on Jan 21 236 This filly is a much better individual than either of her fullsisters Valentine Day and Cerise more scale and much better underpinning She is more like her full brother Taraday Hanover but larger Up to date she is a grandlooking filly Pete Dailey has four promising 2yearold pacers Marquis Pick Gene AbbeDirect Grattan seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time He is a finelooking colt with a good body good set of legs and nice way of going His best mile to date is 22833 Majestic Pick comes next with a mile in 230332 This colt is another finelooking equine Staley Hanover Knight DreamSweetmite Hanover is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his class Best time to date is 23434 Step Aside Direct RhythmWily Widow has worked in 232 on the halfmile track and shows promise Most of Billy

I will be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt Time work a mile in 234 last quarter in 353 In going away Debonnie got behind several lengths stalling at the start she is a little fussy They left the threequarters together and finished almost together Prompt Time shows class This filly is another Adios that wants to trot and trot she did until forced to do otherwise After well broken and equipped with 12oz shoes on behind barefooted in front she would trot a real storm with the master Delvin driving Being placed in the hopples she was completely baffled She hesitated she hopped she rolled and rocked skipped and jumped but in some two weeks she started to pace From that time to this she has shown steady improvement and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds Rain on Friday prevented many workouts but there were a few miles of note on Thursday Those responsible included Stardel Hanover Stars
