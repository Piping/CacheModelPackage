Writers of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumptions that man can master the principles of this causeandeffect universe and that such mastery will necessarily better the human lot On the other hand the bright vision of the future has been directly stated in science fiction concerned with projecting ideal societies science fiction of course is related if sometimes distantly to that utopian literature optimistic about science literature whose period of greatest vigor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries produced Edward Bellamys Looking Backward and H G Wellss A Modern Utopia In Arthur Clarkes Childhoods End 1953 though written after the present flood of dystopias began we can see the bright vision of science fiction clearly defined Childhoods End apparently indebted to Kurd Lasswitzs Utopian romance Auf Zwei Planeten 1897 and also to Wellss Histories Of The Future especially The World Set Free 1914 and The Shape Of Things To Come 1933 describes the bloodless conquest of earth by the Overlords vastly superior creatures who come to our world in order to prepare the human race for its next stage of development an eventual merging with the composite mind of the universe Arriving just in time to stop men from turning their planet into a radioactive wasteland the Overlords unite earth into one world in which justice order and benevolence prevail and ignorance poverty and fear have ceased to exist Under their rule earth becomes a technological utopia Both abolition of war and new techniques of production particularly robot factories greatly increase the worlds wealth a situation described in the following passage which has the true utopian ring Everything was so cheap that the necessities of life were free provided as a public service by the community as roads water street lighting and drainage had once been A man could travel anywhere he pleased eat whatever he fancied without handing over any money With destructive tensions and pressures removed men have the vigor and energy to construct a new human life rebuilding entire cities expanding facilities for entertainment providing unlimited opportunities for education indeed for the first time giving everyone the chance to employ his talents to the fullest Mankind as a result attains previously undreamed of levels of civilization and culture a golden age which the Overlords a very evident symbol of science have helped produce by introducing reason and the scientific method into human activities Thus science is the savior of mankind and in this respect Childhoods End only blueprints in greater detail the vision of the future which though not always so directly stated has nevertheless been present in the minds of most sciencefiction writers Considering then the optimism which has permeated science fiction for so long what is really remarkable is that during the last twelve years many sciencefiction writers have turned about and attacked their own cherished vision of the future have attacked the Childhoods End kind of faith that science and technology will inevitably better the human condition And they have done this on a very large scale with a veritable flood of novels and stories which are either dystopias or narratives of adventure with dystopian elements Because of the means of publication sciencefiction magazines and cheap paperbacks and because dystopian science fiction is still appearing in quantity the full range and extent of this phenomenon can hardly be known though one fact is evident the sciencefiction imagination has been immensely fertile in its extrapolations Among the dystopias for example Isaac Asimovs The Caves Of Steel 1954 portrays the deadly effects on human life of the supercity of the future James Blishs A Case Of Conscience 1958 describes a world hiding from its own weapons of destruction in underground shelters Ray Bradburys Fahrenheit 451 1954 presents a bookburning society in which wall television and hearingaid radios enslave mens minds Walter M Miller Jrs A Canticle For Leibowitz 1959 finds men after the great atomic disaster stumbling back to their previous level of civilization and another catastrophe Frederick Pohls The Midas Touch 1954 predicts an economy of abundance which in order to remain prosperous must set its robots to consuming surplus production Clifford D Simaks How2 1954 tells of a future when robots have taken over leaving men nothing to do and Robert Sheckleys The Status Civilization 1960 describes a world which frightened by the powers of destruction science has given it becomes static and conformist A more complete list would also include Bradburys The Pedestrian 1951 Philip K Dicks Solar Lottery 1955 David Karps One 1953 Wilson Tuckers The Long Loud Silence 1952 Jack Vances To Live Forever 1956 Gore Vidals Messiah 1954 and Bernard Wolfes Limbo 1952 as well as the three perhaps most outstanding dystopias Frederik Pohl and C M Kornbluths The Space Merchants 1953 Kurt Vonneguts Player Piano 1952 and John Wyndhams ReBirth 1953 works which we will later examine in detail The novels and stories like Pohls Drunkards Walk 1960 with the focus on adventure and with the dystopian elements only a dim background in this case an uneasy overpopulated world in which the mass of people do uninteresting routine jobs while a carefully selected universitytrained elite runs everything are in all likelihood as numerous as dystopias There is of course nothing new about dystopias for they belong to a literary tradition which including also the closely related satiric utopias stretches from at least as far back as the eighteenth century and Swifts Gullivers Travels to the twentieth century and Zamiatins We Capeks War With The Newts Huxleys Brave New World E M Forsters The Machine Stops C S Lewiss That Hideous Strength and Orwells Nineteen EightyFour and which in science fiction is represented before the present deluge as early as Wellss trilogy The Time Machine A Story Of The Days To Come and When The Sleeper Wakes and as recently as Jack Williamsons With Folded Hands 1947 the classic story of men replaced by their own robots What makes the current phenomenon unique is that so many sciencefiction writers have reversed a trend and turned to writing works critical of the impact of science and technology on human life Since the great flood of these dystopias has appeared only in the last twelve years it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the chief impetus was the 1949 publication of Nineteen EightyFour an assumption which is supported by the frequent echoes of such details as Room 101 along with education by conditioning from Brave New World a book to which sciencefiction writers may well have returned with new interest after reading the more powerful Orwell dystopia Not all recent science fiction however is dystopian for the optimistic strain is still very much alive in Mission Of Gravity and Childhoods End as we have seen as well as in many other recent popular novels and stories like Fred Hoyles The Black Cloud 1957 and among works of dystopian science fiction not all provide intelligent criticism and very few have much merit as literature but then real quality has always been scarce in science fiction In addition there are many areas of the human situation besides the impact of science and technology which are examined for sciencefiction dystopias often extrapolate political social economic tendencies only indirectly related to science and technology Nevertheless with all these qualifications and exceptions the current dystopian phenomenon remains impressive for its criticism that science and technology instead of bringing utopia may well enslave dehumanize and even destroy men How effectively these warnings can be presented is seen in Pohl and Kornbluths The Space Merchants Vonneguts Player Piano and Wyndhams ReBirth Easily the best known of these three novels is The Space Merchants a good example of a sciencefiction dystopia which extrapolates much more than the impact of science on human life though its most important warning is in this area namely as to the use to which discoveries in the behavioral sciences may be put The novel which is not merely dystopian but also brilliantly satiric describes a future America where onesixteenth of the population the men who run advertising agencies and big corporations control the rest of the people the submerged fifteensixteenths who are the workers and consumers with the government being no more than a clearing house for pressures Like ours the economy of the space merchants must constantly expand in order to survive and like ours it is based on the principle of ever increasing everybodys work and profits in the circle of consumption The consequences of course have been dreadful reckless expansion has led to overpopulation pollution of the earth and depletion of its natural resources For example even the most successful executive lives in a tworoom apartment while ordinary people rent space in the stairwells of office buildings in which to sleep at night soyaburgers have replaced meat and wood has become so precious that it is saved for expensive jewelry and the atmosphere is so befouled that no one dares walk in the open without respirators or soot plugs While The Space Merchants indicates as Kingsley Amis has correctly observed some of the impending consequences of the growth of industrial and commercial power and satirizes existing habits in the advertising profession its warning and analysis penetrate much deeper What is wrong with advertising is not only that it is an outrage an assault on peoples mental privacy or that it is a major cause for a wasteful economy of abundance or that it contains a coercive tendency which is closer to the point Rather what Kornbluth and Pohl are really doing is warning against the dangers inherent in perfecting a science of man and his motives The Space Merchants like such humanist documents as Joseph Wood Krutchs The Measure Of Man and C S Lewiss The Abolition Of Man considers what may result from the scientific study of human nature If man is actually the product of his environment and if science can discover the laws of human nature and the ways in which environment determines what people do then someone a someone probably standing outside traditional systems of values can turn around and develop completely efficient means for controlling people Thus we will have a society consisting of the planners or conditioners and the controlled And this of course is exactly what Madison Avenue has been accused of doing albeit in a primitive way with its hidden persuaders and what the space merchants accomplish with much greater sophistication and precision Pohl and Kornbluths ad men have long since thrown out appeals to reason and developed techniques of advertising which tie in with every basic trauma and neurosis in American life which work on the libido of consumers which are linked to the great prime motivations of the human spirit As the hero Mitchell Courtenay explains before his conversion the job of advertising is to convince people without letting them know that theyre being convinced And to do this requires first of all the kind of information about people which is provided by the scientists in industrial anthropology and consumer research who for example tell Courtenay that three days is the optimum priming period for a closed social circuit to be triggered with a catalytic cuephrase which means that an effective propaganda technique is to send an idea into circulation and then three days later reinforce or undermine it And the second requirement for convincing people without their knowledge is artistic talent to prepare the words and pictures which persuade by using the principles which the scientists have discovered Thus the copywriter in the world of the space merchants is the person who in earlier ages might have been a lyric poet the person capable of putting together words that stir and move and sing As Courtenay explains Here in this profession we reach into the souls of men and women And we do it by taking talent and redirecting it Now the basic question to be asked in this situation is what motivates the manipulators that is what are their values since as Courtenay says Nobody should play with lives the way we do unless hes motivated by the highest ideals But the only ideal he can think of is Sales Indeed again and again the space merchants confirm the prediction of the humanists that the conditioners and behavioral scientists once they have seen through human nature will have nothing except their impulses and desires to guide them
