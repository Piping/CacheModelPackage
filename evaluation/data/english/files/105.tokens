Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents dont want sonnyboy to lift all those old barbell things because youll stunt your growth or because childish taunts from his schoolmates like Hey lookit Mr America whaddya gonna do with all those muscles of which he has none at the time After all a guys gotta have a little ego Therefore its a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates This happy always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior Mr Canada Henri De Courcy Far from discouraging Henri his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority Professor Roland Claude And they couldnt have entrusted Henri to better hands because le professeur knows his muscles from the sternocleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast fast muscle growth Thats because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt Royal East in Montreal Undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prizewinning pupils every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other Theres Gaetan DAmours who is our newest Mr Canada JeanPaul Senesac whose story appeared here two issues ago Jack Boissoneault who was with us last month Charles Harve who recently won the Most Muscular Man subdivision award in the Mr Canada event and a host of others Yesiree the professor knows his muscles Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4 10 tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight About that time he began reading Mr America and Muscle Builder and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight gaining Seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of QuickWate and SuperProtein those two wonderworking Weider food supplements he decided to try them and see what they could do for him Well sir they did real great For in almost less time than it takes to tell it Henris bodyweight was increasing rapidly Of course he did some exercising Hes crazy about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his skinny frame Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really doesnt have to work them very much But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body It was muscular but it wasnt symmetrical A real nothing torso says Henri It never seemed to widen It just got longer and longer Thats when he went to Professor Claude And at once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it In his gym the professor has some of the most knocked out equipment since Vic Tanny Mr Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the nowfamous Weider PushPull SuperSet technique in which one exercise of the SuperSet is a pressing or pushing movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way followed by a pulling exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group So right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous moon bench and proceeded to teach him his first PushPull SuperSet consisting of the widegrip StraightArm Pullover the pull part of the PushPull SuperSet which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the collartocollar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide Reevestype gladiator pecs while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids As you can see in this PushPull Super Set the entire chestbackshoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumpedup all the time Now when Henri has completed four complete PushPull SuperSets No 1 the professor allows him about a fiveminute rest period before starting him on four complete PushPull SuperSets No 2 SuperSet No 2 is made up of similar exercises but this time done with dumbbells and using both moon and flat benches The push exercise of this PushPull SuperSet is the Bench Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs The dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the Aj The pull exercise in this SuperSet is the onedumbbell BentArm Pullover Note how strongly the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pinpoint concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords In the third PushPull SuperSet the push exercise is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars while the pull exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoralribcage stretcher ever invented This is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved Youll know when youve made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch As you see the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a wide grip He has to he just cant do anything about it at all But as you can also see its not a painful exercise at all because Henri De Courcy the happy bodybuilder looks as though he were having the time of his life The last exercise of Roland Claudes prescribed program for Henri is a single exercise done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets By this time Henris entire chestbacklatshoulder area is pumpedup to almost bursting point and Claude takes time to do a bit more pectoralfront deltoid shaping work He has Henri do from four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press note the high incline This gives a wide flare to the pecs causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and Aj This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests that steeledged carvedoutofsolid rock looks of the great champions So with four complete PushPull SuperSets No 1 four of No 2 four of No 3 and four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press you can see that Henri De Courcy has had a terrific massbuilding muscleshaping torsodefining workout that cannot be improved upon Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone Rarer still is a Mr America or Mr Universe of true Herculean build The aspects of physical development that catch the judges eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion superior definition of the muscles Now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional highset highrep lightweight workouts But contest definition that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptors chisel is something quite different This comes not alone from highset highrep training but from certain definitionspecialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others Because they are minority exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten Only when the newest Mr America or Mr Universe discovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once again see how effective they really are The exercise I shall discuss in this the first of a new series of articles on muscle definitionspecialization of a particular body part is the One Leg Lunge Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone no matter whether he has short or long thighbone lengths It is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders a criterion of muscle drama that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike the facet of muscular development that wins prizes Definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which is easily understandable The One Leg Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts But for purely definition purposes used in conjunction with your regular Squatting Leg Curling Leg Extensor programs a heavy weight is not needed Indeed a lighter weight works much better because a greater more extensive split can be performed Used in several sets of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a razorsharp definition in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin Really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times for the following suggestions show why it is so effective 1 Its a complete thigh contractionextension exercise 2 It places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition 3 It improves overall balance and control for the bodybuilder and helps to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed 4 It increases flexibility of the legs 5 It speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately thus enabling a massive concentrated effort to be focused on each Youll need your Weider Power Stands for this fine exercise and heres the way its done 1 Place your Power Stands in position and adjust their height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean 2 Place a suitablyloaded barbell across them grasp the bar which will rest against the back of your neck extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split Now raise the weight by straightening your front leg without moving your feet When the front knee is straight and locked allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the Power Stands 3 After you have taken a breather reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear and the rear thigh now to the front and perform the same movement in the same manner Thats the OneLeg Lunge in a nutshell You should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety You should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balancewise Oh youll wobble and weave quite a bit at first But dont worry Before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it youll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck theres no reason why you shouldnt make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck Squatstyle lifters and legsplit lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front
