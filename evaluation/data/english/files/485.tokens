There was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot The new Riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop For a few innings the Anniston team couldnt figure him out Then in the fifth Annistons kid catcher caught onto a curve and smacked the ball into left center field Eddie Lee Riversides redheaded playing manager ran after the ball but it rolled past him Phil Rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the relay Eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to Phil Third Third base Eddie shouted Phil spun around and made an accurate throw into Mike Deegans hands on third base Mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag But the Anniston boy had begun his slide too late He came into the bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball down full in his face You bastard The Anniston catcher screamed He jumped to his feet and started to throw punches Mike Deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher This brought in everybody from both sides while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar The fighters were separated in a few minutes The game was resumed But Mike Deegan was boiling mad now When the inning was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all the way into the dugout Phil Rossoff coming in from left field stopped at the water fountain for a drink Mike Deegan was standing beside it facing the field He was eyeing the Anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began Keep your eyes open sonny Mike yelled to the catcher Youre in for trouble The Anniston catcher did not reply with words He simply turned to Mike and smiled This so infuriated Deegan that he spun around and said Ill get that little bastard So help me God Ill get him Phil Rossoff said Why dont you leave him alone Mind your own goddamn business Mike Deegan said Phil shrugged He stepped into the dugout wondering why Deegan was always looking for trouble Maybe the answer was in his eyes When Deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips In the last of the sixth inning Mike Deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielders head By the time the fielder got his hands on the ball Deegan was rounding third base and heading for home The left fielder threw and it was a good one But Mike had no chance of being tagged The Anniston catcher was straddling home plate All Deegan had to do was slide fall away but instead he rammed into the catcher Both fell heavily to the ground Only Mike got to his feet He went back to touch home plate turned and walked to the dugout without looking back The Anniston players and their manager ran out on the field They poured water over their catchers face He did not move Then the manager called for a doctor The Riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer Then quickly and a little nervously the doctor ordered a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room Mike Deegan was sitting on the bench watching When the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said That ought to teach the sonofabitch Phil Rossoff seated next to Deegan got up and moved to the other end of the bench The Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout He was followed by four of his men It began to look as if something was going to happen Mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer Eddie Lee moved over to Mike Deegans side No one said a word The Anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of Mike His face was flushed Deegan the manager said his voice pitched low quivering That was a rotten thing to do For Gods sake Mike said waving the manager away Stop it will you Tell your guys not to block the plate You didnt have to ram him Thats what you say The Anniston manager looked at Eddie Lee It was a cold and calculated look He turned and went back across the field to his dugout He called in the pitcher who had been pitching and a big heavy powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston The game started again and in the eighth inning Mike Deegan came up to bat Everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting The first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for Mikes head Deegan fell into the dirt the ball going over him He arose slowly and brushed himself off He got back into the batters box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again Hit the bum Somebody yelled from the Anniston bench In the Riverside dugout Frankie Ricco shortstop whispered into Phils ear Theres gonna be a fight Look at those bastards Charlie Haydon a pitcher said Theyre looking for trouble Mike was slow getting into the box this time When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in Listen He shouted to the pitcher One more and Im coming out there Ill be waiting The pitcher yelled back Mike Deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat He stood flatfooted in the box but not very close to the plate now The pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for Mikes head Deegan dropped got up turned and holding the bat with both hands up against his chest began to walk slowly out to the mound The pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards Mike Deegan They were both walking towards each other unhurried Riverside and Anniston players rushed out on the field In the next moment it seemed the infield was crowded with spectators ballplayers cops kids and a dog There was much shouting and screaming Fights sprang up and were quickly squelched Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together Phil Rossoff and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started After the game Phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in Its a helluva thing Mike said looking at Phil when a guys own teammate wont come out and help him in a fight Phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head Frankie Ricco sat down on the bench near Phil The other players were undressing quietly Eddie Lee had not come in yet Mike went over to Phil and stood over him Why the hell didnt you come out when you saw them gang up on me I didnt think it was necessary Well Now thats just fine You didnt think it was necessary Mike placed both his hands on his hips He pushed his jaw forward Listen wise guy if you think Im gonna do all the fighting for this ball club youre crazy Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mikes face I didnt ask you to fight for the ball club Phil said slowly Nobody else did either You trying to say I started the fight Im not trying to say anything Phil turned away and opened his locker and then he heard Mike Deegan say Youre yellow Rossoff And Phil banged his locker door shut and spun around But before anything could happen Frankie Ricco was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room Phil come into my office Eddie said Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the door He sat down before Eddies desk Im doing you a favor Eddie said quickly You get your unconditional release as of today Phils eyes widened just a trifle The best thing for you to do Eddie said is go home You dont belong in professional baseball Phil had to clear his throat Is this because of what happened out there No Eddie said But it does confirm what Ive suspected all along Phil stood up Listen This is the second time Sit down sit down Eddie said Im not saying youre yellow I am saying youre not a professional ballplayer Eddie Lee leaned forward over the desk Now listen to me Phil Im not steering you wrong You havent got the heart for baseball Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned Suddenly his voice grew hard What the hell do you think baseball is Youre not in the big leagues but if you cant give and take down here what the hell do you think itll be like up there Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short Now dont tell me what a good ball player you are I know youve got talent But what you havent got is the heart to back up that talent with The heart Phil You just havent got the heart for proball and thats it Dazed Phil said I dont get it My batting average Eddie stood up abruptly then sat down just as abruptly What difference does your batting average make Or your fielding average Or even the way you run bases I tell you when its necessary to hurt in order to win you wont do it Thats what I mean by no heart for the game Baseballs no cinch Deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there He did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission thats one less who might take his job away later on What the hell do you think baseball is A sport Its a way of life goddamit And youve got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you Hes wrong Phil thought Its only his opinion There were other clubs in this league He stood up slowly He was a little pale and shaky His lips felt glued together I think youre wrong Eddie he said finally Eddie nodded Okay Youll get your pay in the morning Phil turned and left the room hearing Eddie say Someday youll see I was right Phil shut the door behind him Outside in the dressing room Frankie Ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes What happened Frankie asked Phil said I got my release You crazy Phil shrugged What for Phil sighed Frankie shook his head I dont get it I dont know Phil said They were silent for a few moments Then Frankie said What are you gonna do Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again Phil took off one shoe and stared at it Dont take it like this Frankie said Hell plenty of guys get let out and come back later The leagues are full of guys like that Phil was very quiet What are you gonna do Phil Phil did not answer Why not try another club Phil looked up What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that Springfields in tomorrow Frankie said Talk to Whitey Jackson He just didnt know what he was talking about saying a thing like that Will you do it Phil Do what Ask Whitey for a job Phil nodded Sure he said Springfield come in tomorrow Frankie nodded Ill speak to Whitey Atta boy Ill talk to him all right Dont worry Frankie said Youll get a job there He needs outfielders bad Im not worried about it Phil said Thats the way to talk What else did Eddie have to say Nothing Phil said
