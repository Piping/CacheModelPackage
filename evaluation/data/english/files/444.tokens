When several minutes had passed and Curt hadnt emerged from the livery stable Brenner reentered the hotel and faced Summers across the counter I have a little job for you Charlie Im sure you wont mind doing me a small favor Brenners voice was oily but Summers wasnt fooled He moistened his lips uneasily What is it you want me to do Mr Brenner Brenner shrugged carelessly Its very simple I just want you to take a message to Diane Molinari Tell her to come here to the hotel Vastly relieved Summers nodded and started toward the door One thing Summers Brenner said Youre not to mention my name Tell her Curt Adams wants to see her Summers pulled up short and turned around I dont know Mr Brenner he said haltingly beginning to get an inkling of Brenners plans It doesnt seem quite right telling her a thing like that Couldnt I just His voice trailed off into silence Brenner continued to smile but his eyes were cold He turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadnt before noticed You know Summers he said thoughtfully Eagles Nest ought to have a fire company If someone were to drop a match in here this place would go up like a haystack He started toward the stairway then turned to add Tell her to come to Adamss room that Adams is in trouble Tell her to hurry Yes sir His face pale Summers headed for the street Curts visit to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching He paused only long enough to ascertain that Jesss buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside The fact that Jesss horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that Dianes information had been wrong but Curt didnt interpret it this way A man like Jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed Probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding From the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Blacks house without using the street Curt approached the place cautiously and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees There was a light in Blacks front room but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior Curt circled the house and located a barn out back He could hear horses moving around inside and nothing else There was no lock on the door only an iron hook which he unfastened He opened the door and went in pulling it shut behind him Again he stood in the darkness listening but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor He moved ahead carefully his left hand in front of him and came to a wooden partition Horse smell was very strong and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws He found a match in his pocket and lit it There were two horses in the barn a swaybacked dun and Jess Crouchs buckskin Curt snuffed out the match It was certain now that Jess was in the house but also presumably was Stacey Black Curt wanted to get Jess alone without interference from anyone even as spineless a person as the store owner He studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved Reaching across the side of the stall he slapped the buckskin on the rump The startled animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall As Curt had hoped the house door banged open He slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly its hoofs rattling the side of the stall Curt moved over beside the door and waited Presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard and Jesss smothered curses The door swung open and Jess said sourly What the hells the matter with you The horse continued to snort Curt doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance in its owners voice Jess cursed again and entered the barn A match flared and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop As he crossed to the side of the stall Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer Before you try anything he said Remember what happened to Gruller Jess caught his breath in surprise He started to reach for his gun but apparently thought better of it Thats the stuff Curt said Just hold it that way He reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt You and I have a little talking to do Jess You wont be needing this He moved up and lifted Jesss pistol out of its holster Damn you Adams Jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock We aint got nothing to talk about If I dont come back in the house Breeds going to Your triggerhappy brother isnt in the house About now hes probably having supper That long ride the four of you took mustve given him a good appetite Now turn around so I can see your face Jess turned There was raw fury in his eyes and the veins of his neck were swollen Youre about as dumb as they come Adams I dont know what youre up to but when Brenner You can forget about Brenner too Curt said Its Ben Arbuckle were going to talk about Arbuckle Jess stiffened I dont know nothin about him No I suppose you dont know anything about a piece of twobyfour either one with blood all over it Arbuckles blood Curts fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun So help me Crouch Id like to kill you where you stand but before I do Im going to hear you admit killing him Now start talking Who told you to do it Was it Dutch Brenner Curt was holding Jesss gun in his left hand He drew back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across Jesss face but didnt finish the motion Pistolwhipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like Jess but Curt couldnt bring himself to do it Apparently sensing this and realizing that it gave him an advantage Jess became bold Having all the guns makes you a big man dont it Adams If we was both armed you wouldnt talk so tough No Curt reached out and dropped Jesss pistol back into the holster He retreated a step and holstered his own All right Crouch were on even terms Now draw Sweat bubbled out on Jesss swarthy face The fingers of his right hand twisted into a claw but he didnt reach for the gun Curt angry enough to be a little reckless raised his hands shoulder high Does this make it any easier coward I aint drawin against you Jess said thickly I heard how you outdrew Chico I aint a gunslinger No Youre the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind and hits him with a club I just wanted to hear you say so Jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides He had found Curts weakness or what to Jess was a weakness and was smart enough to take advantage of it Somewhere in the distance a woman screamed Curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention He had to make Jess talk and he had to do it before Stacey Black got curious and came to investigate Once more he lifted Jesss gun from its holster only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin He dropped his own beside it Well do it another way then he said harshly Jesss coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by Curts fist With a roar of pain and fury Jess made his attack Curt managed to duck beneath the mans flailing fist and drove home a solid left to Jesss midsection It was like hitting a sack of salt Pain shot up Curts arm clear to the shoulder but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit He slammed into the wall bounced back and caught Curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning An inch lower and it would have knocked him out As it was his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move When his eyes began to focus he saw Jess charging at him with a pitchfork Curt twisted to one side and the tines of the fork bit into the floor Jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet The tines broke off under Jesss twisting and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curts brains out His aim was hurried so the pitchfork whistled over Curts head By now Curt was seeing clearly again He stepped inside Jesss guard and landed two blows to the big mans belly putting everything he had behind them They made Jess double over When his head came down Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall The building shook setting the lantern to swaying and the buckskin to pitching again Even Blacks old crowbait began to snort and from the house Black yelled Jess Whats going on out there Jess didnt seem too sure himself He lurched drunkenly to his feet lowered his head and took one step away from the wall Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor Jess had had enough Blood gushed from his nose and he backed off as rapidly as he could stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from Curts fists Curt was in almost as bad shape but he wouldnt quit He backed Jess into a corner grabbed a handful of the mans shirtfront and drew back his right fist Tell me about Arbuckle You killed him didnt you It was Brenners idea Jess mumbled dabbing at his nose He found out about you and Arbuckle talking He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble You mean anyone who stood up for his rights Curt said He let go of the shirt and Jess slumped to the floor Turning his back Curt crossed to the stall reached over to untie the buckskins halter rope and waved his hand in the animals face The buckskin bolted out of the stall Curt moved in and picked up his gun He shook loose straw out of the action and placed the gun in his holster Leaving Jesss where it lay he left the stall Get up Crouch Were going someplace Jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door Whos in there Black called fearfully Curt opened the door grabbed Black by the shoulder and pulled him into the barn Youre staying right here for a while This dirty coward just admitted killing Arbuckle Im going to let him tell it to somebody else He shoved Black toward the stall and pointed his pistol at Jess Get out of here Youre coming along peacefully or Ill put a bullet in your leg Jess stumbled through the door Curt followed reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it Black would have little trouble getting out but it might delay him a few minutes Wherere you takin me Jess asked worriedly Were going to Marshal Woodss house Maybe if the marshal hears this himself itll make a difference Somebody in this town must still have some backbone
