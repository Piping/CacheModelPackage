Hotel Escapes Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction the versatile Kings 4 Plus Two This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while a well integrated fast moving outfit specializing in skits vocals comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch Show spotlights the Kings George Worth Bill Kay Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens The Plus Two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine and the beat is solid In the comedy division the Kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props Net result is some crazywonderful nonsense part of which can be classed as pure slapstick Kings 4 have

cooperation of local high schools and business firms Is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communisms growing threat on our doorstep and around the world More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 pm Sunday at First Presbyterian Church At that time the second half of the Christian Youth Crusade against Communism will be staged A young real estate salesman Kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy Air Force He was particularly struck by a course on Communist brainwashing Kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of Communism but never felt there was anything he as an individual could do about it When he attended the Christian AntiCommunist Crusade school here about six months ago Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it The best approach he figured was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote a Biblically strong Christianity So the Christian Youth Crusade against Communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the fourhour program This Sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation a review of the philosophy of Communist leaders by Ted Slack another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the University of Miami and talks on how their Christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting Communism during high school and college days by Ted Place director of Greater Miami Youth for Christ and Jon Braun director of Campus Crusade for Christ The second half of the film Communism on the Map and the movie Operation Abolition also will be shown Response to the program has been so encouraging Kern said that a citywide youth school at Dade County Auditorium may be set up soon And to encourage other churches to try their own programs Kern said this Sundays sessions including the free dinner will be open to anyone who makes reservations The need for and the way to achieve a Christian home will be stressed in special services marking National Christian Family Week in Miami area churches next week Of particular meaning to the Charles MacWhorter

wife have taken part in the twiceayear ceremonies for families with new babies The first one two years ago changed the routine of their home life When you stand up in public and take vows to strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the fundamentals of the Christian faith you strive a little harder to uphold those vows explains the slender vice president of the young couples Sunday school class Until that first dedication service he and Lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home They have five daughters Coral Lee 5 Glenda Rae 4 Pamela 3 Karen 2 and Shari five months But after that service they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table have bedtime prayers and Bible stories To their surprise the children all were eager and quite able to take part Even the twoyearold feels miffed if the family has a prayertime without her Dades chief probation officer Jack Blanton will lead a discussion on The Changes in the
