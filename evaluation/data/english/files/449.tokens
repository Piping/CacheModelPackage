I guided her to the divan turned off the TV faced her She sat quietly staring at me from the wide eyes And what eyes they were Big and dark a melting golden brown Eyes like hot honey eyes that sizzled Plus flawless skin smooth brow and cheeks lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them It was a disturbingly familiar face too but I couldnt remember where we had met I said Do we know each other Miss No I remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here and when it happened all I could think of was This time she stopped the rush of words herself Im sorry Shall I go on She smiled It was her first smile But worth waiting for Sure I said But one word at a time OK She was still hugging the stained coat around her so I said Relax let me take your things Would you like a drink or coffee No thanks She stood up pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off then let out a highpitched scream and I let out a lowpitched wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out She was wearing nothing beneath the coat She jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again but not soon enough There had been a good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out and now I was certain Id seen her somewhere before I forgot She yelped Oh do forgive me Im sorry I forgive Thats what started all the trouble in the first place Oh dear Im all unstrung You and me both dear Havent we havent I seen you I mean surely weve You may have seen me on TV she said Ive done several filmed commercials for Then it hit me Zing I cried Why yes And you recognized me Yes indeed In fact I was watching you on that little seventeeninch screen when you rang my bell Man you rang it was in color too Miss and Miss Whats your name anyway Ah you were splendid I sat by her on the divan Splendid In a waterfall and all that Thats the last one we did That was a fun one Ill bet It was fun for me all right I dont mean to pry but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles I mean Is advertising honest It depends on who does it I never wear anything at all It wouldnt wouldnt seem fair somehow I couldnt agree with you more I really do have something important to tell you Mr Scott About the murder Murder Oh yeah I said Tell me about the murder She told me Zing was the creation of two men Louis Thor and Bill Blake partners in zing Inc Theyd peddled the soap virtually alone and without much success until about a year ago when with the addition of SX21 to their secret formula and the inauguration of a highpowered advertising campaign sales had soared practically into orbit Their product had been endorsed by Good Housekeeping the AMA and the Veterinary Journal among other repositories of higher wisdom and before much longer if you didnt have a cake of their soap in the john even your best friends would think you didnt bathe My lovely caller Joyce Holland was her name had previously done three filmed commercials for zing and this evening the fourth a super production had been filmed at the home of Louis Thor The water in Thors big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick foamy soapsuds fashioned of course from zing Joyce had dived from the board into the pool then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious bath while cameras rolled The finished and drastically cut product would begin with a hazy longshot of Joyce entering the suds then bursting above the pools surface clad in layers of lavender lather and I had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap even to clean men and boys Joyce went on When wed finished Lou Mr Thor asked me to stay a little longer He wanted a few stills for magazine ads he said Everybody left and I stayed in the pool then Lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too And he didnt have any clothes on He didnt Yes he didnt Did I mean She paused Did leap into the pool and didnt have anything on Anyway it was evident what he had in mind You got away didnt you Yes He caught up with me once and grabbed me but I was all covered with zing its very slippery you know I didnt know I wouldnt have the stuff in the house But Im pleased to hear So I just scooted out of his clutches I swam like mad got out of the pool grabbed my robe and ran to the car The keys were still in it and I was miles away before I remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where Id changed Shed driven around for a while Joyce said then thinking Louis Thor would have calmed down by that time shed gone back to his home on Bryn Mawr Drive parked in front and walked toward the pool While several yards from it still concealed by the shrubbery shed seen two men on her left at the pools edge She went on A man was holding onto Lou holding him up Maybe Lou was only unconscious but right then I thought he must be dead The man shoved him into the water then ran past the cabana Theres a walk there that goes out to Quebec Drive I was so scared well I just ran to my car and came here You know who the other man was No I never did see his face I didnt get a good look at him at all his back was to me and I was so scared It was just somebody in a mans suit But Im sure the other one was Lou What Joyce wanted me to do was go to Thors house and do whatever detectives do and get her clothes and handbag containing her identification She realized Id have to notify the police but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name Her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series Underwater Western Eye a documentarytype show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits But if Joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal the role would probably go to the sponsors wife Mrs Oatnut Grits Or at least not to Joyce And I so want the part she said The commercials have just been for money there hasnt been any real incentive for me to do them but in Underwater Western Eye Id have a chance to act I could show what I can do As far as I was concerned she had already and had dandily shown what she could do But I promised Joyce I would mention her name if at all only as a last resort Seeming much relieved she smiled one of those worthwaitingfor smiles and I smiled all the way into the bedroom There I got my Colt Special and shoulder harness slipped my coat on and went back into the front room Joyce squirmed a little on the divan Im starting to itch she said Itch Yes Im still all covered with that soap I was loaded with suds when I ran away and I havent had a chance to wash it off Mmmm it sure itches You might as well wait here while Im gone so you can use my shower if youd like Oh Id love to I showed her the shower and tub and she said smiling If you really dont mind I think Ill get clean in the shower then soak for a few minutes in your tub That always relaxes me Doesnt it you Only when I do it I shook my head One of my virtues or vices is a sort of threedimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color Soak as long as you want Joyce Itll probably be at least an hour or two before I can check back with you So youll have everything all to yourself doggone I looked at my watch Ten after nine Time to go I supposed Well goodbye I said Goodbye Youd better hurry Oh you can count on that She smiled slightly Softly Warmly Dont hurry too much Ill be soaking for at least half an hour That was all she said But suddenly those hothoney eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them However when theres a job to be done Im a monstrosity of grim determination I like to think I spun about and clattered through the front room to the door As I went out I could hear water pouring in the shower Hot water She wouldnt be taking a cold shower Hell she couldnt Bryn Mawr Drive is only two or three miles from the Spartan and it took me less than five minutes to get there But the scene was not the quiet calm scene Id expected Four cars were parked at the curb and two of them were police radio cars Lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds I followed a shrubberylined gravel path alongside the house to the pool Two uniformed officers a couple of plainclothesmen I knew and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left At the pools far end was the little cabana Joyce had mentioned and on the waters surface floated scattered lavender patches of limplooking lather A few yards beyond the group of men a mans nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra Lieutenant Rawlins one of the plainclothesmen spotted me and said Hi Shell and walked toward me Howd you hear about this one I grinned but ignored the question He didnt push it Rawlins worked out of Central Homicide and wed been friends for years He filled me in A call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine PM and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that 10 minutes ago now Present at the scene in addition to the dead man who was indeed Louis Thor had been Thors partner Bill Blake and Antony Rose an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account Neither of them I understood had been present at the filming session earlier What were they doing here I asked Rawlins They were supposed to meet Thor at nine PM for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap a new angle based on this SX21 stuff Yeah Ive heard more about SX21 than space exploration lately What is the gunk How would I know Its a secret That was the new advertising angle something about a Lloyds of London policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient Actually only two men know what the formula is Blake and He stopped and looked at Thors body I said OK so now only Blake knows Hows it strike you foul or fair Cant say yet Deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on em The PM might show he drowned instead but thats what the onceoverlightly gives us Accident murder suicide take your pick Ill pick murder Anything else According to Rose he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water got a hooked pole from the poolequipment locker and started hauling him out
