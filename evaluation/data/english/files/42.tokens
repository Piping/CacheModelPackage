Holders of tollroad bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes Longterm trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their tollroad bonds Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes investors who bought tollroad bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these taxexempt bonds Other taxexempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21 according to Standard & Poors average On balance prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then However in the same threemonth period tollroad bonds as a group have bucked this trend On these bonds price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines Taxfree returns Investors however still see an element of morethanordinary risk in the tollroad bonds You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page Many of the tollroad bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent or very close to that And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to or beyond the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds Its not much more in fact than the return that is offered on U S Treasury bonds For investors whose income is taxed at high rates though a taxfree yield of 4 per cent is high It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16000 of income to be taxed or for a married couple with more than $32000 of taxed income Swelling traffic A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12month period ending in February or March shows what is happening The report is based on a survey by Blyth & Company investment bankers Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period And there is the bright note The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter Indication The longterm trend of turnpike traffic is upward Look for example at the Ohio Turnpike Traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February as compared with those same months in 1960 Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues after operating costs As a result the roads net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds That was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike Operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 but up for the 12 months ending in March Costs were held down despite a bitter winter For the year the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs against 121 per cent in the preceding period The roads engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston Slow successes Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do The 187mile Illinois State Toll Highway for example was not opened over its entire length until December 1958 In the 12 months ended in February 1960 the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load with the remainder paid out of initial reserves In the 12 months ended in February 1961 this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest That improvement is continuing In the first two months of 1961 earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 Success for many turnpikes has come hard Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers rosy estimates In these cases the turnpike managements have had to turn to tollrate increases or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways Many rate increases already have been put into effect Higher tolls are planned for July 1 1961 on the RichmondPetersburg Va Turnpike and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study Easier access Progress is being made too in improving motorists access to many turnpikes The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb 28 1961 Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961 with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City Kans and Kansas City Mo Meanwhile there appears to be enough money in the roads reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years For some roads troubles Investors studying the tollroad bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike If nothing is done the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months and despite recent improvement in revenues holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same These however are exceptions The typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement Its going to take time for investors to learn how many of the tollroad bonds will pay out in full Already however several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the breakeven point A top American official after a look at Europes factories thinks the US is in a very serious situation competitively Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges accompanied by a member of our staff on May 10 toured plants of two of Italys biggest companies Fiat the auto producer and Olivetti maker of typewriters and calculating machines Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant and you learn this One modern equipment much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan enables Fiat to turn out 2100 cars a day About half of these are exported Two wage costs are a fraction of the US costs A skilled worker on the assembly line for example earns $37 a week Three labor troubles are infrequent Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years Said Secretary Hodges Its a tough combination for the US to face Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges Olivetti took over Underwood the US typewriter maker in late 1959 Within a year without reducing wages Underwoods production costs were cut one third prices were slashed The result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout modern machinery The firm is designconscious salesconscious advertisingconscious Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the US The inflow of foreign capital would help the US balance of payments Hodges predicted I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the US There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these An international conference of the big textileimporting and textileexporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting The US will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the lessdeveloped countries over the years Point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first need encouragement to get on their feet If they have trouble exporting international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would Idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible At the same time another purpose of the conference will be to get certain lowwage countries to control textile exports especially dumping of specific products to highwage textileproducing countries Japan since 1957 has been voluntarily curbing exports of textiles to the US Hong Kong India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the Lancashire Pact None of these countries is happy with these arrangements The Japanese want to increase exports to the US While they have been curbing shipments they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big US market Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons The Kennedy hope is that at the conference or through bilateral talks the lowwage textileproducing countries in Asia and Europe will see that dumping practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas Gradual controlled expansion of the worlds textile trade is what President Kennedy wants This may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products Its an important clue to Washington thinking Note too that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the US textile industry Get competitive or get out In veiled terms thats what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines where modernization doesnt seem feasible Special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed Government research will look into new products and methods Import quotas arent ruled out where the national interest is involved But the Kennedy Administration doesnt favor import quotas Rather they are impressed with the British Governments success in forcing and helping the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products Whats happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from lowwage countries Among the highestpaid workers in the world are US coal miners Yet US coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers mouths water Steel Company of Wales a British steelmaker wants to bring in Virginia coal cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively especially in foreign markets Virginia coal delivered by ship in Wales will be about $280 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines US coal is cheap despite high wages because of widespread mechanization of mines wide coal seams attactive rates on ocean freight Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting narrow and very deep Productivity of US miners is twice that of the British Welsh coal miners Communistled are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American coal They threaten to strike The British Government will have to decide whether to let US coal in The British coal industry is unprofitable has large coal stocks it cant sell
