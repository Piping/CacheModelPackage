How he wondered does one enjoy ones spare time He considered some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk Then there was exercise boating and hiking which was not only good for you but also made you more virile the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted Perhaps golf with a fashionable companion but hed lost his clubs hadnt played in years There was swimming over at the Riverside Hotel but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a frog Perhaps a packing trip into the Sierras let his beard grow but that was too stark I could he thought take a long walk but where The telephone rang You missed it Buzzs voice said You should have gone over to the Pagan Room with us Wow Strippers but scrumptious and Toodle Williams and her alllesbian band Hi Buzz Owen said I went over to the Willows and dropped two notes Tough Buzz said Listen were having a stag dinner over at the Pagan Room on Friday Imagine a stag dinner with Toodle Williams He laughed and laughed Owen wanted to be pleasant because Buzz worked the territory next to his but he hadnt come to Reno for stag dinners Thanks Owen said but Friday is a long way off and anything can happen Buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest When Owen was finally rid of him there was a timid rap at the door Yes Owen called out Yes Im Mrs Gertrude Parker a soft voice explained And Id like to talk to you for a few minutes please Ahah he thought a lush divorcee at last Probably saw me in the lobby He was disappointed to find a nervous scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the door She frowned at his green pajamas with the yellow moons How do you do She said semiprofessionally Our church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in Alaska We call them laysisters and they go among the Eskimos making friends and bringing the light Theyre up there in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them Oh You see she said looking past him into the room where the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light you and I cant understand the many hardships they have to undergo Why is that She apparently wasnt satisfied with his reaction Smug Owen thought smug and sappy There was a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye It gave her a lewd winking effect Have you ever tried to reason with an Eskimo She asked winking wildly They are a very difficult group of people I dont know much about them Owen admitted but I suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do She smiled in a sicklytolerant fashion You know thats very interesting People dont know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that The more canvassing I do the more I note how far most people are from their personal God Forebearing Owen kept his peace What would happen next That she was out for a touch was certain but when did she get to the pitch Several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated trying to close the door a little and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice How did you get by the desk He asked curiously Im sure the hotel doesnt know youre wandering around the corridors knocking on strangers doors and talking down Eskimos Oh I just come once a week Every day I visit a different hotel I feel its my duty I do this work all on my own because I understand the difficulties and I want to help these laysisters Do you know these women go all through Alaska and they dont have the proper facilities They travel in pairs as much as a hundredandfifty miles a day Do you have any idea how far I travel every day I have the whole Pacific Northwest Owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he couldnt help himself Mrs Gertrude Parker drew back Thats hardly a Christian approach she remonstrated Youre in the secular world I didnt say it was Christian I dont think youll find many active Christian salesmen Not that religion isnt big business those bibles and prayer books make a lot of money for publishing houses but they dont get top personnel Our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics God I take it plays no part in this she said waspishly God doesnt have any appliance or cosmetics he said heatedly before he caught himself It sounded silly why go on More people were passing he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation And whiskey she said smiling and blinking at the highball glasses Dont forget whiskey its such a big seller You know he said getting a grip on himself I think youre going to have to excuse me I have an appointment I can imagine she said Probably down at the bar But what do you want to do about the laysisters They must be freezing up there now Cant you help them Leave a card or something Ill think it over I have no card she said bitterly You havent been listening to what Ive been telling you I only hope my talking to you has helped you a little anyway because you need spiritual buckingup She looked crestfallen as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race She stood indecisively for a moment then walked down the hall he heard her knocking on another door It took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself then he realized he was hungry He showered shaved dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast On the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail There was a check from his company and the usual enthusiastic bulletins on new lines they always issued His lawyer had sent him a statement on his overdue alimony and there was a letter from the Collector of Internal Revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last years exemptions He ate breakfast in a sullen mood but afterwards when he walked out onto Virginia Street he felt braced He looked off to the crest of the Sierras still whitetopped the glisten of the Truckee River made a wide spangle He felt suddenly elated adventurous With any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot Although it was only three oclock he stopped in at the Golden Calf The tables were all spinning the dice rattling the bar crowded Just to test himself he played roulette for quarters on his old combination five and seventeen and within an hour he had won surprisingly twenty dollars The way was opening up when the management brought around champagne the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach The Golden Calf was dimly lit with shaded neon There were more women than men in the place but he couldnt find a flowerpot They all had the hard look of gamblers who had stopped dreaming who automatically turned the cards hardly caring what showed up The mural around the wall depicted early settlers in covered wagons who appeared much more animated than the gamblers The women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance while the men were stern but hopeful All of course except the Donner party who were bent on starving to death I wonder if they did eat each other at the end Owen mused He sat down next to a heavilyupholstered blonde but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes She sighed a dirty word and left Owen was surprised to see Mrs Gertrude Parker playing the onearm bandits that were cunningly arranged by the entrance She sat down and played two slots at once looking grim as if bested by mechanical devices and Owen felt sorry for the laysisters depending on her support A driedup cowboy sat down next to him in the blondes place He was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables What you need is a steady martingale the cowboy announced after watching Owen play You cant build on your hitandmiss fiveseventeen What are you playing Owen asked Im just logging the cowboy explained I keep all these plays in this little black book and I watch over a twelvehour period to find out what numbers are repeating But roulettes not my game Im always trying to find a breaking table in blackjack Incidentally Im pretty famous in these parts Im called The Wrangler Nice to know you Dont you have to spend any time on your ranch Well of course I do Im with the BarH pushing a horse called Sparky Hes my own horse and what I collect from him I use on blackjack This Sparky can rack and singlefoot and hes the fastest thing in Washoe County I figure if I can get any kind of publicity campaign going Ill land him on TV you know one of those favorite horses for some Western hero I once trained a horse for Hoot Gibson but nothing like Sparky Hes a pinto and he photographs wonderfully Five came up while Owen was listening to The Wrangler and he neglected to play a loss of ten dollars This proved conclusively that The Wrangler was a jinx so he walked on down to Hurrays an even more glorified gambling den than the Golden Calf When he looked in the back Mrs Gertrude Parker was marking keno cards His adventurous spirit had waned he studied the pistol exhibition that Hurrays featured as an added attraction He ogled a long redhead with green eyes but she was a shill with her money in front of her He had no great prejudice against shills it just seemed such a dry run There was no cash around everyone was flipping silver dollars The management discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave the customers chips or checks or premium points He read a special announcement whereby Hurrays would feature a special floorshow at three AM starring Adele The Body Brenner and fourteen glamorous schoolgirls He wondered if he might bag a tourist but they looked frightened of him He passed two brides both wearing orchids and they made him feel a little sad Owen found Buzz watching chuckaluck Buzz had on a Hawaiian shirt and was carrying some suntan oil and dark glasses He was shorter and fatter than Owen who felt good standing next to him Were all going over to Lake Tahoe and try our luck at CalNeva Buzz explained still instigating We ran into a guy at the Pagan Room who guarantees we can beat the wheel He started out as a stickman then became a pit boss until the Club found him crossroading He was knocking down checks at faro Im allergic to Tahoe Owen explained Something about the pollen Well okay Buzz said Well see you around later Owen went over to the crap table and the dice were hot but he couldnt pyramid with any consecutive success Hows your luck honey A short platinum blonde in a bursting sunsuit addressed him She looked wellfed and prosperous but he didnt get the impression he was being propositioned the way hed been hoping I havent had any luck since I was a baby Stake me she said and let me at those dice Ill make them dance the tango Well get it in a hurry and get it out Lets have a drink and discuss a merger If you go broke she said smiling up at him Ill leave you Sounds like real love Owen said It sort of brings a lump to my throat My names Gisele the blonde said after she ordered a Scotch Named after the ballet My mother wanted to call me Sylphide but it sounded too affected
