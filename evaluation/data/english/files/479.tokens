She called then to say she had a babysitter for that night Shirley appreciated the chance to make some money Such a nice little thing lives right in the building Thats swell I said sweetly I could get along without that three dollars In some ways it was worth being out the money just knowing I was no longer obligated to Nadine It was past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang I stumbled through the hall wondering who would be calling at this hour I answered to find Nadine at the other end You scared me half to death I said shakily Whats wrong Janice nobody answers at the apartment Her voice came shrill Im absolutely frantic That stupid girl might have gone off and left Francie Oh she wouldnt do that I said Shes probably fallen asleep and doesnt hear the phone But if youre worried you can go home and check I cant leave the party Were at Ken Thoms apartment and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat Old Mr Thom is already down on Wally and we simply cant afford to get Ken mad at us I was all set for what came next Janice could you possibly go over and make sure everythings all right Ill call you there in ten minutes I cant make it in ten minutes Wondering as I said it why I should make it at all Why should I go over at midnight to check on Francie when her parents didnt care enough to leave a party Fifteen minutes then Please Janice Ill be glad to pay you So sure that money could do anything All right I said Id do it Not for the dollar or so Nadine would give me But because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment and if I didnt go over who would Chris was sound asleep and I didnt see any sense in waking him I dressed in the kitchen then left a note on the table telling him what had happened I drove off through the cool darkness to Nadines apartment and rang the bell and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door Her face was flushed from sleep Its all right I said as she started to look scared Mrs Roberts had called and couldnt wake you I just came over to make sure everything was all right Im hard to wake up she faltered She didnt look over thirteen And Nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable I have to get up early for church tomorrow she went on I didnt know it was going to be this late The phone started ringing Thats Mrs Roberts again I said Ill answer it I crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone I told Nadine everything was fine and that Id be getting on home Janice would you mind staying There was a ragged edge to her voice now as if shed been crying Wallys drunk Ill get him out of here as soon as I possibly can but I dont want Shirley to see him like this You know how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building Not a word of thanks for what Id already done The receiver clicked in my ear She didnt even give me a chance to refuse Well there wasnt any law that said I had to stay But then I looked at Shirley and thought that I might as well the child needed her sleep and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be with Wally coming home drunk So I told her Mrs Roberts would pay her in the morning and she scooted off to her own apartment After I looked in at Francie I went into the living room and waited I must have dozed off because I came to with a start at the sound of voices Nadines shrill with anger Wallys loud and thick As I went to the door I heard the clock strike two I opened the door and Wally stumbled in fast as if Nadine had pushed him I had always thought she was so beautiful But now she looked ugly Her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out and if looks could kill Wally would have been dead Pack your clothes she hissed Pack and get out Youre crazy Wally said thickly He lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it and was instantly asleep Nadine strode over to him and her pointed nails raked across his face I grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second I thought that maybe Wally was right and she was crazy You stay out of this she spat at me Hes ruined us do you hear me hes ruined us He insulted Ken Thom Her eyes were wild He told Ken to his face that he doesnt have what it takes to get a woman And the other people there were listening Were ruined and hes going to get out if I have to throw him down the stairs youd better simmer down I said nervously I was plenty scared In the state she was in she could actually kill him Now you just take it easy and Ill make you some tea Tea Nadine screeched How can you be so damn stupid Wallys lost his job Ken will never forgive him never And we dont have any money we dont have a dime All we own is Francies bedroom set and the televisonrecord player and we even owe on them And well be poor and have to live in a grubby little house like yours and all because of that I clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of filth Stop that Youll wake up the whole building Wally cant go any place at this hour Well then Ill get out But she looked uncertain She was coming to her senses enough to realize that you dont go traipsing off anywhere at two in the morning You go to bed I said curtly In the morning you and Wally can talk things out She collapsed against me as if everything inside her snapped I got her into bed and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out It was three oclock before I figured it was all right to go I left her a limp bundle of selfpity shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her Wally was snoring on the davenport I had done all I could I had done all I was going to do Whether or not Wally lost his job was no concern of mine I drove home found Chris still asleep I snuggled up close to him loving him thankful for a man like him Thankful I wasnt Nadine I kept on being thankful In the afternoon Nadine and Wally came over with Francie Wally sat in our big chair his hands between his knees looking ready to cry Id had all this trouble with the old man thats why I drank so much I got fired yesterday for not attending to business Old Mr Thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job Wally confessed and couldnt get one because there were cars on the pits waiting to be repaired Seems that the kid Wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side Mr Thom had gotten Wally on the phone and fired him I thought Id smooth things over through Ken Wally said miserably But Ken got coy and wouldnt make any promises And I was plastered and I blew my stack And told him right to his face hed never slept with a woman I tried to quiet Nadine because the children were there But she was beyond caring what she said Things may smooth over yet Chris said his nice lean face grave with honest concern But I couldnt help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just what they deserved Now maybe theyd realize that life can be tough When A bubble breaks theres nothing Little by little during the week Chris and I discovered the crazy unbelievable way Nadine and Wally had lived They had not only spent every cent they were in debt up to their necks owing on everything they owned On top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent and the day Wally received written notice that he was fired they were evicted Worst of all Wally had no training for any kind of work He had fallen into a soft job and now the job was gone and he was stranded Chris fretted I wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over I said I wished we were too It was easy enough to say it because of course we couldnt spare a cent But Chris brightened up like a candle Im glad you feel that way honey There is one big way we can help them We can let them move in with us Something I had simply never thought of Something so incredible I just stared at him It was incredible He gave me an embarrassed pleading look I know wed be pretty crowded But it would only be for a couple of weeks until they get straightened out Straightened out Theyd had years of making all that money I wont do it I said flatly Nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this Well now she can sleep in the street for all I care That isnt like you Janice Chris said uncomfortably Then I felt uncomfortable too I didnt want to be like that mean and bitter But darn it all why should we help a couple of spoiled snobs who had looked down their noses at us But in the end we did It just seemed as if there was nothing else to do The finance company took all their furniture and they didnt have a cent to their name Then Wally got sick To my way of thinking he was scared sick His luck had failed him and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world Chris made trip after trip in our old car moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of groceries Nadine had bought on special At least well eat I thought grimly as I put all the food away While I worked Nadine sat and cried When she wasnt crying she was in our bedroom fighting with Wally Virus infection nothing shed scream at him Youre too lazy to go out and look for another job Youre just a nogood bum It was a mess all right But it couldnt go on forever A couple of weeks Chris had said I figured I could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks But the two weeks dragged into three and they were still with us Nadines constant nagging had finally gotten Wally out of bed He set out every morning looking for work and come home around noon full of alibis and excuses Wendell Thom had blackballed him Nobody would even take his application You can get something Nadine would snap You can get a job working in a grocery store if nothing else The high school kids have got everything sewed up he said a whine in his voice Those damn punks taking work away from men who need it By fall theyll be back in school Id say trying to sound encouraging But this was only the middle of July And I couldnt take six more weeks of this I mentioned it to Chris one stifling hot night when I had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air
