The group upon the issuance of its first press release on December 21 1957 designated itself a Committee of Investigation In the course of its inquiry it took testimony from only seven witnesses It heard BangJensen twice and his lawyer Adolf A Berle Jr once Its second press release was on January 15 1958 and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed It also implied that Paul BangJensen had been irresponsible On January 18 Ernest Gross conducted a press conference at the UN lasting an hour Here he openly attacked BangJensen and referred to his aberrant conduct This conference was held despite Stavropoulos assurance to Adolf Berle who was leaving the same day for Puerto Rico that nothing would be done until his return on January 22 except that the Secretary General would probably order the list destroyed On January 24 Paul BangJensen accompanied by Adolf Berle was met by Dragoslav Protitch and Colonel Frank Begley former Police Chief of Farmington Conn and now head of UN special police The four bundled in overcoats mounted to the windswept roof of the UN There Begley lit a fire in a wire basket and BangJensen dropped four sealed envelopes into the flames In one of these he said were notes on the identities of the eightyone refugees The method of destroying the evidence embarrassed Paul BangJensen He knew it would be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence He was right and Peter Marshall could not help but recall Andrew Cordiers words on the subject Well it seemed as good a place as any to do the job The Gross group had been formed for the express purpose of advising the Secretary General Hammarskjolds supposed desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of Ernest Gross is illusion at best Grosss being outside the UN applied only to a physical state not an objective one But by the time the papers were finally disposed of the group had informed the world of its purpose its recommendations and its belief that Paul BangJensen was not of sound mind Shortly the group would issue its report to the Secretary General recommending Paul BangJensens dismissal from the United Nations The contents of this 195page document would become known to many before it would become known to the man it was written about Until this Hungarian Committee matter came up BangJensen was a fine and devoted individual I had known him for some years when I was a delegate and before and this manner had never been his Ernest A Gross leaned back in his chair and told Peter Marshall how Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold had on December 4 1957 called him in as a private lawyer to review BangJensens conduct relating to his association with the Special Committee on the problem of Hungary The result was the Gross Report prepared by Gross as chairman with the assistance of two UN Under Secretaries Constantin Stavropoulos and Philippe De Seynes Yes Gross went on BangJensen was an upandcoming young man He had always done well Never well known but he had done his work competently Gross had received Marshall courteously and they were discussing the case You know the lawyer said its difficult to talk like this about a man who cant answer back Gross was behind a cleantop desk only a manila folder before him Marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs Outside the office windows twentyfour stories above Wall Street a light rain was falling Mr Gross your report says that our function is investigative and advisory and does not in any way derogate from or prejudice Mr BangJensens rights as a staff member You know BangJensen characterized your Committee as having prejudged his case Gross swung his swivel chair Well how could that have been I dont consider that he was prejudged We were given a job and we carried it out and later his case was taken up by the Disciplinary Committee We have nothing to hide under a bushel We did our job Mr Stavropoulos and Mr De Seynes and myself taking evidence from a number of people What did you think about his mental state I think our report sums up our finding Gross answered Dont forget here was a man who had been accusing his colleagues for almost a year of willfully attempting to present an incorrect report This was not merely alleging errors but was carried out by dayafterday allegations in memos written charges of serious consequence This is a distressing thing Supposing you or I were being accused in this manner and yet we were doing our level best to carry on our work No organization can carry on like that Ive been in government and I can tell some pretty hairy stories about personnel difficulties so I know what a problem he was What Id like you to comment on is the criticism leveled at your Committee What do you mean For instance regarding the fact that the Gross Committee issued two interim announcements to the press during its investigation You know BangJensen was told the Committee was to convey its views suggestions and recommendations to the Secretary General In his own words BangJensen took it for granted that the Group would report to the Secretary General privately and not in public He claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was prejudicial to his position Gross bristled For an instant he glared speechless at Marshall Listen he said I thought the entire report was going to be confidential from beginning to end But you know BangJensen launched an active campaign against us in the press It was getting so that we the Committee were being tried You can find it in the papers Well as a matter of fact Ive looked through backissue files of New York papers for December 1957 and havent found a great deal Gross shot another look at Marshall It wasnt necessarily all here in New York Dont forget the foreign press Then what about the second interim public announcement This cited BangJensens aberrant conduct The reason for that report was to settle the matter of the list As far as Im concerned it was a separate matter from the general Committee study of BangJensens conduct The January fifteen report recommended that BangJensen be instructed to burn the list the papers in the presence of a UN Security Officer How about your press conference three days later what was the reason for that BangJensen said you told correspondents that you had checked in advance to make sure the term aberrant conduct was not libelous He claimed you made other slanderous allegations Gross paused and repeated himself The entire object of the press conference was to clarify the problem of the list since many in the press were querying the UN about it What was the list I dont know BangJensen never explained what the documents or papers were that he had in his possession It was foolish of him to keep them whatever they were He could have been blackmailed or his family might have been threatened Of course the matter caught the publics attention We attempted to conclude this and did so by having the papers burned Hammarskjold didnt like the way it was carried out It was a sort of Gotterdammerung affair Hammarskjold believes the UN is an organization that settles matters in a procedural way Peter Marshall reflected If Hammarskjold had not wanted the list disposed of in this manner and if BangJensen had not wanted it who had ordered it Mr Gross concerning the formation of your Committee theres the fact that you have been a legal adviser to the UN in the past as I understand it Mr Hammarskjold wanted outside advice Could you comment on that Ive served as a counsel for the UN for some years specializing particularly in real estate matters or other problems that the regular UN legal staff might not be equipped to handle Mr Stavropoulos is the UN legal chief and a very good man but he is not fully versed on some technical points of American law What did you think about BangJensens contention of errors and omissions in the Hungarian report Marshall asked Those Gross answered Why Mick Shann went over and over the report with Alsing Andersen trying to check them out Even after the incident between BangJensen and Shann in the Delegates Lounge and this was not the way the Chicago Tribune presented it Gross reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings One was an article on the UN by Alice Widener from the Cincinnati Enquirer The other was by Chesly Manley in the Chicago Daily Tribune Gross pointed to the Manley story I know Ches hes a friend of mine He probably didnt mean to write it this way or maybe he did There wasnt any violent argument between BangJensen and Shann as the Tribune puts it That implies that Shann was on the enemy side You see what I mean How its phrased there the word violent The case was that BangJensen came up to Shann claiming he had found further errors in the report Ive found errors and I want you to look them over So once again Shann had to argue with him about this But it wasnt a violent discussion And after all this Shann went over all that BangJensen had brought up Shanns own report Peter Marshall reflected describes the encounter as immoderate BangJensen was in hysterical condition Gross stopped briefly then went on Shann was responsible for the report He has felt terrible about all this It was a good report he did all he could to make it a good report When I speak of how Shann felt I know well Dont forget I am an old member of the club a former delegate I think you are being unfair to take these things up now You know this hits in many areas It appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the Hungarian situation Dont forget the UN did no more than the United States did It takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to get the impact of this fact Chapter 22 from the home of his friend Henrik Kauffmann in Washington DC Paul BangJensen sent a telegram dated December 9 1957 to Ernest Gross It said in part the matters to be considered are obviously of a grave character and I therefore respectfully request that the hearing be postponed for two weeks in order that I might make adequate preparation Ernest Gross replied the next day putting the suspended diplomats fears to rest This reveals some misunderstanding on your part The group conducting the review is not holding formal hearings It wished to pursue in the course of this review questions arising from the body of material already in its possession It sounded like a fair enough invitation Peter Marshall reflected and BangJensen must have thought so too because on the thirteenth he met the group of three on the thirtysixth floor of the UN There Ernest Gross further assured him We were requested by the Secretary General as I understand it to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the Secretariat The only rules which I think we shall follow will be those of common sense justice and fairness Peter Marshall noted that BangJensen had later referred to his two interviews with the Gross group as unfortunate experiences and after his second meeting on the sixteenth the Dane refused to attend further hearings without legal counsel Marshall pondered the reason for this and pondered too the replacement of one member of the threeman group J A C Robertson after serving Gross one week left for England
