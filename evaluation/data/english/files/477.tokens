Unimpressed the dog plopped on the sand Quint couldnt blame Maggie for disbelieving For eleven days theyd done the same thing leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast before Esperanza Beach got jammed with tourists and beach balls and showoffy lifeguards The swirling sand made Quints limp more pronounced They walked slowly past the sherbetcolored cottages eleven lemon nine mint seven orange around the curve to a deserted stand with an Eats sign jiggling in the wind Now they were in friendly territory Nobody around Nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping jaggedly to the waters edge His rock was to the right of a Vshaped inlet a big brown lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers His rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here Here he was enclosed and safe If a dragon or a sea monster came along didnt he have a red Swiss hunting knife on his belt ten blades and a corkscrew Here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe He was Canute controlling the waves He was a knight of the Round Table Sir Quintus the Brave slaying evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses One good thing about a suit of armor his leg wouldnt show He was the first astronaut on the moon chosen because of his small size and intrepid nature He was six feet one like his father with big hands and a hairy chest a man the weak and persecuted would turn to Fearless Every night when he wanted a drink of water didnt he practice being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light A dark bathroom can be pretty scary and hed creep back to bed proud of himself thinking Tomorrow for sure Ill go down to the rock and keep my promise to Dad He hadnt intended to make the promise It happened two weeks ago the night before his father left on a business trip to South America Every piece of the nightmare was clear in place and when he woke up his father was saying Stop screaming Quint Its all right Stop shaking He could remember the feel of his fathers big hands the thump of his fathers heart sending out signals regular like radar Lets talk about the beach Son While Im gone you get brown and fat as a pig hear Look I can put two fingers between the cords in the back of your neck Dr Fortman says swimming would help your leg He says youre limping more than you need to How does he know Big dumb nut He never had polio In the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out You just wait Dad When you get back Ill probly be swimming better than Victoria Wait and see Dad Victoria was fourteen months younger than Quint a head taller and could lick any boy or girl on the beach He called her Fatso She called him Stuckup thats why nobody plays with you Mister Stuckup Or what was worse she prayed for him out loud at bedtime Please Lord Gord please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised Shes got a nerve Quint said now to the clouds Strength began to zip up and down his chest He felt strong as a giant He unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg He wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks Goolick goooolick creaked a sea gull Aw shut up he said He stood on the rock a skinny dignified boy surrounded by the ocean The wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there bleeding wedged between the rocks and the waves I cant go in Im scared of the nightmare Shivering he put on his clothes And shivering with shame he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water Watch it big shot a hoarse voice yelled back She was holding on to his rock with one hand She smelled of peppermints She wore a bathing suit like his mothers no straps on the shouders Why didnt you duck He snapped This is my rock Isnt Is Isnt Is She was sore as a boil Ever hear of squatters rights Sure They started with the KansasNebraska Bill of eighteen Mister Big Britches arent you Im Mark Gordon Peters the Fifth They call me Quint Then why dont you stop squinting I said Quint Thats short for Quintus Quintus in Latin means I can speak both kinds of Latin smart aleck Her cough sounded like cloth ripping You shouldnt smoke so much he said unconsciously imitating Victorias holierthanthou voice I dont smoke She was horrified Do you Hell yes Not having said hell before he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum Sometimes eleven fourteen a day If I was your mama Id wop your tail off My mother never wops me Ive got this leg brace She seemed so unimpressed that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see his brace Dingylooking was what she said Why dont you paint it red and white like a barber pole Because maybe I wont have to wear it always Dr Fortman says if I exercise my leg more maybe I can use a cane when Im big She spouted a mouthful of water into the air A canes mighty handy Someones walking past you want to stop him zoooop snag him around the neck with the crook in your cane Or say a waiter brings you a bowl of soup with a dead fly in it all you got to do is bannnnnng stooooomp your cane on the floor Hey will you look at that Maggie had shaken himself awake and was licking the sand off his stubby whiskers and his long plume of a tail Thats some dog What kind Part collie part wirehaired terrier Quint glared He always did when people asked Holy mackerel thats the most unique dog I ever saw she said firmly His real names DiMaggio only we call him Maggie because he has to take tranquilizers Hes braver than he looks Hes been sick lately Last Tuesday he went on a ham jag A what He would have told her but Victoria was yodeling That meant Mama wants you Quint Come home or Ill come find you I gotta go Even though this is my rock you can use it sometimes I come early in the morning So do I See you around Mister Squint That was how they started being friends They met next morning and all the mornings thereafter Same time early before the fog burned off because she didnt like the sun it made her blister Her name was Sabella and the strip of seaweed around her neck was an emerald necklace the King gave her as a token of his undying love You going to marry the King No Hes got a long beard and picks his teeth with a fork My hair is what hes nuts about Naturally curly hair runs in my family Personally I prefer straight hair like yours but as they say on the Continent What can one do Which continent Name one I been there Japan she said smelled pugh because people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as rocks then they scraped off the mold and made fish soup Pugh Camels in Tripoli had harelips Near Galway the tinkers drove their caravans down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night As for dancing holy mackerel he ought to see the gypsies in Jerez they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with them Really Quint smothered a yawn She made better pictures than any book hed read but he didnt say so Artfully as the days went by he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the Navy Cross in the Korean War that his baby sister could spit up through her nose when she felt like it that he personally had an IQ of 141 and was currently reading the Mushr to Ozon volume of the encyclopedia Books are for schnooks She skipped a piece of water at him and laughed a funny hoarse laugh he liked to hear Nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as Sabella What did one tonsil say to the other tonsil Lets get dressed up the doctors taking us out tonight And What time did the Chinaman go to the dentist Toothhurty Encouraged by her giggles he imitated Maggie who was crazy about ham He described the ham decorated with pineapple and cherries cooling on the porch He snuck up on the ham like Maggie gumming it with soft stumpy teeth then panting with thirst lapping up the water in the lagoon swelling up like a balloon staggering home to be sick while his mother said That does it That dog has to go Say youre quite a comic Sabella said admiringly Ever thought about going on the stage He hadnt But it was such a nice thought that he nodded his head Either that or a veterinarian Better make up your mind son Sabella said You cant serve cod and salmon Sometimes they argued She said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward His encylopedia agreed with Sabella Next morning he tied a bunch of sea daisies with string and threw them across the Vshaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around Boy could she catch Like Willie Mays in the outfield Nobody gave me flowers before Thank you Quint Her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough You can always tell a real gentleman they got a certain je ne say quok Sometimes they didnt talk at all He daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around Once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered Dont feel like it he was tempted to tell her about being scared But Victoria began yodeling just then and he went home carrying Sabella in the back of his head not thinking about her just knowing she was there smiling smelling of peppermints As for his promise oh he had plenty of time buckets of time Wednesday morning it happened They were eating breakfast We beseech thee Lord Gord to bless this food that was Victoria saying grace while the baby sprayed raisin toast on her plastic bib Same old breakfast till the phone rang making his mothers voice shake with excitement Your Daddys in San Francisco she told them He says hell be here on the oneoclock plane Fifteen days early isnt that wonderful Yeah keen A cave seemed to be opening in Quints stomach Children well have to get organized The baby can have an early nap Victoria I want you to Quint closed the screen door quietly so Maggie wouldnt be scared Hurry up were late he said noticing with a chill how gray the sky was this morning the fog like a rope along the horizon the choppy waves sending off sheets of blue and KoolAid green The cave in his stomach hurt He had to go into the water Hed tell Sabella about the nightmare It had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung What caused it he didnt know The metal collar gagging his neck Sweating so much The unbearable weight on his chest All of it together meant drowning The first time the nurse took him out of the lung she said if he got frightened shed put him back for a second
