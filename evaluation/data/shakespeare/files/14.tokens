When all aloud the wind doth blow , And coughing drowns the parson's saw , And birds sit brooding in the snow , And Marian's nose looks red and raw , When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl , Then nightly sings the staring owl , Tu-who ; Tu-whit , tu-who a merry note , While greasy Joan doth keel the pot . The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo . You , that way : we , this way .
