Boatswain ! Here , master : what cheer ? Good , speak to the mariners : fall to't yarely , or we run ourselves aground : bestir , bestir . Heigh , my hearts ! cheerly , cheerly , my hearts ! yare , yare ! Take in the topsail . Tend to the master's whistle .Blow , till thou burst thy wind , if room enough ! Good boatswain , have care . Where's the master ? Play the men . I pray now , keep below . Where is the master , boson ? Do you not hear him ? You mar our labour : keep your cabins : you do assist the storm . Nay , good , be patient . When the sea is . Hence ! What cares these roarers for the name of king ? To cabin : silence ! trouble us not . Good , yet remember whom thou hast aboard . None that I more love than myself . You are a counsellor : if you can command these elements to silence , and work the peace of the present , we will not hand a rope more ; use your authority : if you cannot , give thanks you have lived so long , and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour , if it so hap .Cheerly , good hearts !Out of our way , I say . I have great comfort from this fellow : methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him ; his complexion is perfect gallows . Stand fast , good Fate , to his hanging ! make the rope of his destiny our cable , for our own doth little advantage ! If he be not born to be hanged , our case is miserable . Down with the topmast ! yare ! lower , lower ! Bring her to try with main-course . A plague upon this howling ! they are louder than the weather , or our office . Yet again ? what do you here ? Shall we give o'er , and drown ? Have you a mind to sink ? A pox o' your throat , you bawling , blasphemous , incharitable dog ! Work you , then . Hang , cur , hang ! you whoreson , insolent noisemaker , we are less afraid to be drowned than thou art . I'll warrant him for drowning ; though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell , and as leaky as an unstanched wench . Lay her a-hold , a-hold ! Set her two courses ; off to sea again ; lay her off . All lost ! to prayers , to prayers ! all lost ! What , must our mouths be cold ? The king and prince at prayers ! let us assist them , For our case is as theirs . I am out of patience . We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards . This wide-chapp'd rascal ,would thou might'st lie drowning , The washing of ten tides ! He'll be hang'd yet , Though every drop of water swear against it , And gape at wid'st to glut him . 'We split , we split !' 'Farewell , my wife and children !' 'Farewell , brother !' 'We split , we split , we split !' ] Let's all sink wi' the king . Let's take leave of him . Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground ; long heath , brown furze , any thing . The wills above be done ! but I would fain die a dry death . If by your art , my dearest father , you have Put the wild waters in this roar , allay them . The sky , it seems , would pour down stinking pitch , But that the sea , mounting to th' welkin's cheek , Dashes the fire out . O ! I have suffer'd With those that I saw suffer : a brave vessel , Who had , no doubt , some noble creatures in her , Dash'd all to pieces . O ! the cry did knock Against my very heart . Poor souls , they perish'd . Had I been any god of power , I would Have sunk the sea within the earth , or e'er It should the good ship so have swallow'd and The fraughting souls within her . Be collected : No more amazement . Tell your piteous heart There's no harm done . O , woe the day ! No harm . I have done nothing but in care of thee , Of thee , my dear one ! thee , my daughter !who Art ignorant of what thou art , nought knowing Of whence I am : nor that I am more better Than Prospero , master of a full poor cell , And thy no greater father . More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts . 'Tis time I should inform thee further . Lend thy hand , And pluck my magic garment from me .So : Lie there , my art .Wipe thou thine eyes ; have comfort . The direful spectacle of the wrack , which touch'd The very virtue of compassion in thee , I have with such provision in mine art So safely order'd , that there is no soul No , not so much perdition as an hair , Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heard'st cry , which thou saw'st sink . Sit down ; For thou must now know further . You have often Begun to tell me what I am , but stopp'd , And left me to a bootless inquisition , Concluding , 'Stay ; not yet .' The hour's now come , The very minute bids thee ope thine ear ; Obey and be attentive . Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell ? I do not think thou canst , for then thou wast not Out three years old . Certainly , sir , I can . By what ? by any other house or person ? Of anything the image tell me , that Hath kept with thy remembrance . 'Tis far off ; And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants . Had I not Four or five women once that tended me ? Thou hadst , and more , Miranda . But how is it That this lives in thy mind ? What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time ? If thou remember'st aught ere thou cam'st here , How thou cam'st here , thou may'st . But that I do not . Twelve year since , Miranda , twelve year since , Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power . Sir , are not you my father ? Thy mother was a piece of virtue , and She said thou wast my daughter ; and thy father Was Duke of Milan , and his only heir A princess ,no worse issued . O , the heavens ! What foul play had we that we came from thence ? Or blessed was't we did ? Both , both , my girl : By foul play , as thou say'st , were we heav'd thence ; But blessedly holp hither . O ! my heart bleeds To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to , Which is from my remembrance . Please you , further . My brother and thy uncle , call'd Antonio , I pray thee , mark me ,that a brother should Be so perfidious !he whom next thyself , Of all the world I lov'd , and to him put The manage of my state ; as at that time , Through all the signiories it was the first , And Prospero the prime duke ; being so reputed In dignity , and for the liberal arts , Without a parallel : those being all my study , The government I cast upon my brother , And to my state grew stranger , being transported And rapt in secret studies . Thy false uncle Dost thou attend me ? Sir , most heedfully . Being once perfected how to grant suits , How to deny them , who t'advance , and who To trash for over-topping ; new created The creatures that were mine , I say , or chang'd 'em , Or else new form'd 'em : having both the key Of officer and office , set all hearts i' the state To what tune pleas'd his ear ; that now he was The ivy which had hid my princely trunk , And suck'd my verdure out on't .Thou attend'st not . O , good sir ! I do . I pray thee , mark me . I , thus neglecting worldly ends , all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that , which , but by being so retir'd , O'erpriz'd all popular rate , in my false brother Awak'd an evil nature ; and my trust , Like a good parent , did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was ; which had , indeed no limit , A confidence sans bound . He being thus lorded , Not only with what my revenue yielded , But what my power might else exact ,like one , Who having , into truth , by telling of it , Made such a sinner of his memory , To credit his own lie ,he did believe He was indeed the duke ; out o' the substitution , And executing th' outward face of royalty , With all prerogative :Hence his ambition growing , Dost thou hear ? Your tale , sir , would cure deafness . To have no screen between this part he play'd And him he play'd it for , he needs will be Absolute Milan . Me , poor man ,my library Was dukedom large enough : of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable ; confederates , So dry he was for sway ,wi' the king of Naples To give him annual tribute , do him homage ; Subject his coronet to his crown , and bend The dukedom , yet unbow'd ,alas , poor Milan ! To most ignoble stooping . O the heavens ! Mark his condition and the event ; then tell me If this might be a brother . I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother : Good wombs have borne bad sons . Now the condition . This King of Naples , being an enemy To me inveterate , hearkens my brother's suit ; Which was , that he , in lieu o' the premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute , Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom , and confer fair Milan , With all the honours on my brother : whereon , A treacherous army levied , one midnight Fated to the purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan ; and , i' the dead of darkness , The ministers for the purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self . Alack , for pity ! I , not rememb'ring how I cried out then , Will cry it o'er again : it is a hint , That wrings mine eyes to 't . Hear a little further , And then I'll bring thee to the present business Which now's upon us ; without the which this story Were most impertinent . Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us ? Well demanded , wench : My tale provokes that question . Dear , they durst not , So dear the love my people bore me , nor set A mark so bloody on the business ; but With colours fairer painted their foul ends . In few , they hurried us aboard a bark , Bore us some leagues to sea ; where they prepar'd A rotten carcass of a boat , not rigg'd , Nor tackle , sail , nor mast ; the very rats Instinctively have quit it : there they hoist us , To cry to the sea that roar'd to us ; to sigh To the winds whose pity , sighing back again , Did us but loving wrong . Alack ! what trouble Was I then to you ! O , a cherubin Thou wast , that did preserve me ! Thou didst smile , Infused with a fortitude from heaven , When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt , Under my burden groan'd ; which rais'd in me An undergoing stomach , to bear up Against what should ensue . How came we ashore ? By Providence divine . Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan , Gonzalo , Out of his charity ,who being then appointed Master of this design ,did give us ; with Rich garments , linens , stuffs , and necessaries , Which since have steaded much ; so , of his gentleness , Knowing I lov'd my books , he furnish'd me , From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom . Would I might But ever see that man ! Now I arise : Sit still , and hear the last of our sea-sorrow . Here in this island we arriv'd ; and here Have I , thy schoolmaster , made thee more profit Than other princes can , that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so careful . Heavens thank you for't ! And now , I pray you , sir , For still 'tis beating in my mind ,your reason For raising this sea-storm ? Know thus far forth . By accident most strange , bountiful Fortune , Now my dear lady , hath mine enemies Brought to this shore ; and by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star , whose influence If now I court not but omit , my fortunes Will ever after droop . Here cease more questions ; Thou art inclin'd to sleep ; 'tis a good dulness , And give it way ;I know thou canst not choose . Come away , servant , come ! I'm ready now . Approach , my Ariel ; come ! All hail , great master ! grave sir , hail ! I come To answer thy best pleasure ; be't to fly , To swim , to dive into the fire , to ride On the curl'd clouds : to thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality . Hast thou , spirit , Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee ? To every article . I boarded the king's ship ; now on the beak , Now in the waist , the deck , in every cabin , I flam'd amazement : sometime I'd divide And burn in many places ; on the topmast , The yards , and boresprit , would I flame distinctly , Then meet , and join : Jove's lightnings , the precursors O' the dreadful thunder-claps , more momentary And sight-outrunning were not : the fire and cracks Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble , Yea , his dread trident shake . My brave spirit ! Who was so firm , so constant , that this coil Would not infect his reason ? Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and play'd Some tricks of desperation . All but mariners , Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel , Then all a-fire with me : the king's son , Ferdinand , With hair up-staring ,then like reeds , not hair , Was the first man that leap'd ; cried , 'Hell is empty , And all the devils are here .' Why , that's my spirit ! But was not this nigh shore ? Close by , my master . But are they , Ariel , safe ? Not a hair perish'd ; On their sustaining garments not a blemish , But fresher than before : and , as thou bad'st me , In troops I have dispers'd them 'bout the isle . The king's son have I landed by himself ; Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle and sitting , His arms in this sad knot . Of the king's ship The mariners , say how thou hast dispos'd , And all the rest o' the fleet . Safely in harbour Is the king's ship ; in the deep nook , where once Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew From the still-vex'd Bermoothes ; there she's hid : The mariners all under hatches stow'd ; Who , with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour , I have left asleep : and for the rest o' the fleet Which I dispers'd , they all have met again , And are upon the Mediterranean flote , Bound sadly home for Naples , Supposing that they saw the king's ship wrack'd , And his great person perish . Ariel , thy charge Exactly is perform'd : but there's more work : What is the time o' th' day ? Past the mid season . At least two glasses . The time 'twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously . Is there more toil ? Since thou dost give me pains , Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd Which is not yet perform'd me . How now ! moody ? What is't thou canst demand ? My liberty . Before the time be out ? no more ! I prithee Remember , I have done thee worthy service ; Told thee no lies , made no mistakings , serv'd Without or grudge or grumblings : thou didst promise To bate me a full year . Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee ? No . Thou dost ; and think'st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep , To run upon the sharp wind of the north , To do me business in the veins o' th' earth When it is bak'd with frost . I do not , sir . Thou liest , malignant thing ! Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax , who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop ? hast thou forgot her ? No , sir . Thou hast . Where was she born ? speak ; tell me . Sir , in Argier . O ! was she so ? I must , Once in a month , recount what thou hast been , Which thou forget'st . This damn'd witch , Sycorax , For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing , from Argier , Thou know'st , was banish'd : for one thing she did They would not take her life . Is not this true ? Ay , sir . This blue-ey'd hag was hither brought with child And here was left by the sailors . Thou , my slave , As thou report'st thyself , wast then her servant : And , for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands , Refusing her grand hests , she did confine thee , By help of her more potent ministers , And in her most unmitigable rage , Into a cloven pine ; within which rift Imprison'd , thou didst painfully remain A dozen years ; within which space she died And left thee there , where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill-wheels strike . Then was this island , Save for the son that she did litter here , A freckled whelp hag-born ,not honour'd with A human shape . Yes ; Caliban her son . Dull thing , I say so ; he that Caliban , Whom now I keep in service . Thou best know'st What torment I did find thee in ; thy groans Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts Of ever-angry bears : it was a torment To lay upon the damn'd , which Sycorax Could not again undo ; it was mine art , When I arriv'd and heard thee , that made gape The pine , and let thee out . I thank thee , master . If thou more murmur'st , I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters . Pardon , master ; I will be correspondent to command , And do my spiriting gently . Do so ; and after two days I will discharge thee . That's my noble master ! What shall I do ? say what ? what shall I do ? Go make thyself like a nymph of the sea : be subject To no sight but thine and mine ; invisible To every eyeball else . Go , take this shape , And hither come in't : go , hence with diligence ! Awake , dear heart , awake ! thou hast slept well ; Awake ! The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me . Shake it off . Come on ; We'll visit Caliban my slave , who never Yields us kind answer . 'Tis a villain , sir , I do not love to look on . But , as 'tis , We cannot miss him : he does make our fire , Fetch in our wood ; and serves in offices That profit us .What ho ! slave ! Caliban ! Thou earth , thou ! speak . There's wood enough within . Come forth , I say ; there's other business for thee : Come , thou tortoise ! when ? Fine apparition ! My quaint Ariel , Hark in thine ear . My lord , it shall be done . Thou poisonous slave , got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam , come forth ! As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd With raven's feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both ! a south-west blow on ye , And blister you all o'er ! For this , be sure , to-night thou shalt have cramps , Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up ; urchins Shall forth at vast of night , that they may work All exercise on thee : thou shalt be pinch'd As thick as honeycomb , each pinch more stinging Than bees that made them . I must eat my dinner . This island's mine , by Sycorax my mother , Which thou tak'st from me . When thou camest first , Thou strok'dst me , and mad'st much of me ; wouldst give me Water with berries in't ; and teach me how To name the bigger light , and how the less , That burn by day and night : and then I lov'd thee And show'd thee all the qualities o' th' isle , The fresh springs , brine-pits , barren place , and fertile . Cursed be I that did so !All the charms Of Sycorax , toads , beetles , bats , light on you ! For I am all the subjects that you have , Which first was mine own king ; and here you sty me In this hard rock , whiles you do keep from me The rest o' th' island . Thou most lying slave , Whom stripes may move , not kindness ! I have us'd thee , Filth as thou art , with human care ; and lodg'd thee In mine own cell , till thou didst seek to violate The honour of my child . Oh ho ! Oh ho !would it had been done ! Thou didst prevent me ; I had peopled else This isle with Calibans . Abhorred slave , Which any print of goodness will not take , Being capable of all ill ! I pitied thee , Took pains to make thee speak , taught thee each hour One thing or other : when thou didst not , savage , Know thine own meaning , but wouldst gabble like A thing most brutish , I endow'd thy purposes With words that made them known : but thy vile race , Though thou didst learn , had that in't which good natures Could not abide to be with ; therefore wast thou Deservedly confin'd into this rock , Who hadst deserv'd more than a prison . You taught me language : and my profit on't Is , I know how to curse : the red plague rid you , For learning me your language ! Hag-seed , hence ! Fetch us in fuel ; and be quick , thou'rt best , To answer other business . Shrug'st thou , malice ? If thou neglect'st , or dost unwillingly What I command , I'll rack thee with old cramps , Fill all thy bones with aches ; make thee roar , That beasts shall tremble at thy din . No , pray thee ! I must obey : his art is of such power , It would control my dam's god , Setebos , And make a vassal of him . So , slave ; hence ! Come unto these yellow sands , And then take hands : Curtsied when you have , and kiss'd , The wild waves whist , Foot it featly here and there ; And , sweet sprites , the burden bear . Hark , hark ! The watch-dogs bark : Hark , hark ! I hear The strain of strutting Chanticleer Where should this music be ? i' th' air , or th' earth ? It sounds no more ;and sure , it waits upon Some god o' th' island . Sitting on a bank , Weeping again the king my father's wrack , This music crept by me upon the waters , Allaying both their fury , and my passion , With its sweet air : thence I have follow'd it , Or it hath drawn me rather ,but 'tis gone . No , it begins again . Full fathom five thy father lies ; Of his bones are coral made Those are pearls that were his eyes : Nothing of him that doth fade , But doth suffer a sea-change Into something rich and strange . Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell : Hark ! now I hear them ,ding-dong , bell . The ditty does remember my drown'd father . This is no mortal business , nor no sound That the earth owes :I hear it now above me . The fringed curtains of thine eye advance , And say what thou seest yond . What is't ? a spirit ? Lord , how it looks about ! Believe me , sir , It carries a brave form :but 'tis a spirit . No , wench ; it eats and sleeps , and hath such senses As we have , such ; this gallant which thou see'st , Was in the wrack ; and , but he's something stain'd With grief ,that's beauty's canker ,thou might'st call him A goodly person : he hath lost his fellows And strays about to find 'em . I might call him A thing divine ; for nothing natural I ever saw so noble . It goes on , I see , As my soul prompts it .Spirit , fine spirit ! I'll free thee Within two days for this . Most sure , the goddess On whom these airs attend !Vouchsafe , my prayer May know if you remain upon this island ; And that you will some good instruction give How I may bear me here : my prime request , Which I do last pronounce , is ,O you wonder ! If you be maid or no ? No wonder , sir ; But certainly a maid . My language ! heavens ! I am the best of them that speak this speech , Were I but where 'tis spoken . How ! the best ? What wert thou , if the King of Naples heard thee ? A single thing , as I am now , that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples . He does hear me ; And , that he does , I weep : myself am Naples , Who with mine eyes ,ne'er since at ebb ,beheld The king , my father wrack'd . Alack , for mercy ! Yes , faith , and all his lords ; the Duke of Milan , And his brave son being twain . The Duke of Milan , And his more braver daughter could control thee , If now 'twere fit to do't .At the first sight They have changed eyes :delicate Ariel , I'll set thee free for this ! A word , good sir ; I fear you have done yourself some wrong : a word . Why speaks my father so ungently ? This Is the third man that e'er I saw ; the first That e'er I sigh'd for : pity move my father To be inclin'd my way ! O ! if a virgin , And your affection not gone forth , I'll make you The Queen of Naples . Soft , sir : one word more They are both in either's powers : but this swift business I must uneasy make , lest too light winning Make the prize light . One word more : I charge thee That thou attend me . Thou dost here usurp The name thou ow'st not ; and hast put thyself Upon this island as a spy , to win it From me , the lord on't . No , as I am a man . There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple : If the ill spirit have so fair a house , Good things will strive to dwell with't . Follow me . Come ; I'll manacle thy neck and feet together : Sea-water shalt thou drink ; thy food shall be The fresh-brook muscles , wither'd roots and husks Wherein the acorn cradled . Follow . No ; I will resist such entertainment till Mine enemy has more power . O dear father ! Make not too rash a trial of him , for He's gentle , and not fearful . What ! I say , My foot my tutor ?Put thy sword up , traitor ; Who mak'st a show , but dar'st not strike , thy conscience Is so possess'd with guilt : come from thy ward , For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop . Beseech you , father ! Hence ! hang not on my garments . Sir , have pity : I'll be his surety . Silence ! one word more Shall make me chide thee , if not hate thee . What ! An advocate for an impostor ? hush ! Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he , Having seen but him and Caliban : foolish wench ! To the most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels . My affections Are then most humble ; I have no ambition To see a goodlier man . Come on ; obey : Thy nerves are in their infancy again , And have no vigour in them . So they are : My spirits , as in a dream , are all bound up . My father's loss , the weakness which I feel , The wrack of all my friends , or this man's threats , To whom I am subdued , are but light to me , Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid : all corners else o' th' earth Let liberty make use of ; space enough Have I in such a prison . Come on . Thou hast done well , fine Ariel ! Follow me . Hark , what thou else shalt do me . Be of comfort ; My father's of a better nature , sir , Than he appears by speech : this is unwonted , Which now came from him . Thou shalt be as free As mountain winds ; but then exactly do All points of my command . To the syllable . Come , follow .Speak not for him . Beseech you , sir , be merry : you have cause , So have we all , of joy ; for our escape Is much beyond our loss . Our hint of woe Is common : every day some sailor's wife , The masters of some merchant and the merchant , Have just our theme of woe ; but for the miracle , I mean our preservation , few in millions Can speak like us : then wisely , good sir , weigh Our sorrow with our comfort . Prithee , peace . He receives comfort like cold porridge . The visitor will not give him o'er so . Look , he's winding up the watch of his wit ; by and by it will strike . Sir , One : tell . When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd , Comes to the entertainer A dollar . Dolour comes to him , indeed : you have spoken truer than you purposed . You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should . Therefore , my lord , Fie , what a spendthrift is he of his tongue ! I prithee , spare . Well , I have done : but yet He will be talking . Which , of he or Adrian , for a good wager , first begins to crow ? The old cock . The cockerel . Done . The wager ? A laughter . A match ! Though this island seem to be desert , Ha , ha , ha ! So you're paid . Uninhabitable , and almost inaccessible , Yet Yet He could not miss it . It must needs be of subtle , tender , and delicate temperance . Temperance was a delicate wench . Ay , and a subtle ; as he most learnedly delivered . The air breathes upon us here most sweetly . As if it had lungs , and rotten ones . Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen . Here is everything advantageous to life . True ; save means to live . Of that there's none , or little . How lush and lusty the grass looks ! how green ! The ground indeed is tawny . With an eye of green in't . He misses not much . No ; he doth but mistake the truth totally . But the rarity of it is ,which is indeed almost beyond credit , As many vouch'd rarities are . That our garments , being , as they were , drenched in the sea , hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses ; being rather new-dyed than stain'd with salt water . If but one of his pockets could speak , would it not say he lies ? Ay , or very falsely pocket up his report . Methinks , our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric , at the marriage of the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis . 'Twas a sweet marriage , and we prosper well in our return . Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen . Not since widow Dido's time . Widow ! a pox o' that ! How came that widow in ? Widow Dido ! What if he had said , widower neas too ? Good Lord , how you take it ! Widow Dido , said you ? you make me study of that : she was of Carthage , not of Tunis . This Tunis , sir , was Carthage . Carthage ? I assure you , Carthage . His word is more than the miraculous harp . He hath rais'd the wall , and houses too . What impossible matter will he make easy next ? I think he will carry this island home in his pocket , and give it his son for an apple . And , sowing the kernels of it in the sea , bring forth more islands . Ay ? Why , in good time . Sir , we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter , who is now queen . And the rarest that e'er came there . Bate , I beseech you , widow Dido . O ! widow Dido ; ay , widow Dido . Is not , sir , my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it ? I mean , in a sort . That sort was well fish'd for . When I wore it at your daughter's marriage ? You cram these words into mine ears , against The stomach of my sense . Would I had never Married my daughter there ! for , coming thence , My son is lost ; and , in my rate , she too , Who is so far from Italy remov'd , I ne'er again shall see her . O thou , mine heir Of Naples and of Milan ! what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee ? Sir , he may live : I saw him beat the surges under him , And ride upon their backs : he trod the water , Whose enmity he flung aside , and breasted The surge most swoln that met him : his bold head 'Bove the contentious waves he kept , and oar'd Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To the shore , that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd , As stooping to relieve him . I not doubt He came alive to land . No , no ; he's gone . Sir , you may thank yourself for this great loss , That would not bless our Europe with your daughter , But rather lose her to an African ; Where she at least is banish'd from your eye , Who hath cause to wet the grief on't . Prithee , peace . You were kneel'd to and importun'd otherwise By all of us ; and the fair soul herself Weigh'd between loathness and obedience , at Which end o' the beam should bow . We have lost your son , I fear , for ever : Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business' making , Than we bring men to comfort them : the fault's Your own . So is the dearest of the loss . My lord Sebastian , The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in ; you rub the sore , When you should bring the plaster . Very well . And most chirurgeonly . It is foul weather in us all , good sir , When you are cloudy . Foul weather ? Very foul . Had I plantation of this isle , my lord , He'd sow't with nettle-seed . Or docks , or mallows . 'And were the king on't , what would I do ? 'Scape being drunk for want of wine . I' the commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things ; for no kind of traffic Would I admit ; no name of magistrate ; Letters should not be known ; riches , poverty , And use of service , none ; contract , succession , Bourn , bound of land , tilth , vineyard , none ; No use of metal , corn , or wine , or oil ; No occupation ; all men idle , all ; And women too , but innocent and pure ; No sovereignty , Yet he would be king on't . The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning . All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavour : treason , felony , Sword , pike , knife , gun , or need of any engine , Would I not have ; but nature should bring forth , Of its own kind , all foison , all abundance , To feed my innocent people . No marrying 'mong his subjects ? None , man ; all idle ; whores and knaves . I would with such perfection govern , sir , To excel the golden age Save his majesty ! Long live Gonzalo ! And ,do you mark me , sir ? Prithee , no more : thou dost talk nothing to me . I do well believe your highness ; and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen , who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing . 'Twas you we laugh'd at . Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you ; so you may continue and laugh at nothing still . What a blow was there given ! An it had not fallen flat-long . You are gentlemen of brave mettle : you would lift the moon out of her sphere , if she would continue in it five weeks without changing . We would so , and then go a-bat-fowling . Nay , good my lord , be not angry . No , I warrant you ; I will not adventure my discretion so weakly . Will you laugh me asleep , for I am very heavy ? Go sleep , and hear us . What ! all so soon asleep ! I wish mine eyes Would , with themselves , shut up my thoughts : I find They are inclin'd to do so . Please you , sir , Do not omit the heavy offer of it : It seldom visits sorrow ; when it doth It is a comforter . We two , my lord , Will guard your person while you take your rest , And watch your safety . Thank you . Wondrous heavy . What a strange drowsiness possesses them ! It is the quality o' the climate . Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink ? I find not Myself dispos'd to sleep . Nor I : my spirits are nimble . They fell together all , as by consent ; They dropp'd , as by a thunder-stroke . What might , Worthy Sebastian ? O ! what might ?No more : And yet methinks I see it in thy face , What thou should'st be . The occasion speaks thee ; and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head . What ! art thou waking ? Do you not hear me speak ? I do ; and surely , It is a sleepy language , and thou speak'st Out of thy sleep . What is it thou didst say ? This is a strange repose , to be asleep With eyes wide open ; standing , speaking , moving , And yet so fast asleep . Noble Sebastian , Thou let'st thy fortune sleep die rather ; wink'st Whiles thou art waking . Thou dost snore distinctly : There's meaning in thy snores . I am more serious than my custom : you Must be so too , if heed me ; which to do Trebles thee o'er . Well ; I am standing water . I'll teach you how to flow . Do so : to ebb , Hereditary sloth instructs me .
