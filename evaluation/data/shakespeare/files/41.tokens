Before we proceed any further , hear me speak . Speak , speak . You are all resolved rather to die than to famish ? Resolved , resolved . First , you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people . We know't , we know't . Let us kill him , and we'll have corn at our own price . Is't a verdict ? No more talking on't ; let it be done . Away , away ! One word , good citizens . We are accounted poor citizens , the patricians good . What authority surfeits on would relieve us . If they would yield us but the superfluity , while it were wholesome , we might guess they relieved us humanely ; but they think we are too dear : the leanness that afflicts us , the object of our misery , is as an inventory to particularise their abundance ; our sufferance is a gain to them . Let us revenge this with our pikes , ere we become rakes : for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread , not in thirst for revenge . Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius ? Against him first : he's a very dog to the commonalty . Consider you what services he has done for his country ? Very well ; and could be content to give him good report for't , but that he pays himself with being proud . Nay , but speak not maliciously . I say unto you , what he hath done famously , he did it to that end : though soft-conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country , he did it to please his mother , and to be partly proud ; which he is , even to the altitude of his virtue . What he cannot help in his nature , you account a vice in him . You must in no way say he is covetous . If I must not , I need not be barren of accusations : he hath faults , with surplus , to tire in repetition . What shouts are these ? The other side o' the city is risen : why stay we prating here ? to the Capitol ! Come , come . Soft ! who comes here ? Worthy Menenius Agrippa ; one that hath always loved the people . He's one honest enough : would all the rest were so ! What work's , my countrymen , in hand ? Where go you With bats and clubs ? The matter ? Speak , I pray you . Our business is not unknown to the senate ; they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do , which now we'll show 'em in deeds . They say poor suitors have strong breaths : they shall know we have strong arms too . Why , masters , my good friends , mine honest neighbours , Will you undo yourselves ? We cannot , sir ; we are undone already . I tell you , friends , most charitable care Have the patricians of you . For your wants , Your suffering in this dearth , you may as well Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them Against the Roman state , whose course will on The way it takes , cracking ten thousand curbs Of more strong link asunder than can ever Appear in your impediment . For the dearth , The gods , not the patricians , make it , and Your knees to them , not arms , must help . Alack ! You are transported by calamity Thither where more attends you ; and you slander The helms o' the state , who care for you like fathers , When you curse them as enemies . Care for us ! True , indeed ! They ne'er cared for us yet : suffer us to famish , and their storehouses crammed with grain ; make edicts for usury , to support usurers ; repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich , and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor . If the wars eat us not up , they will ; and there's all the love they bear us . Either you must Confess yourselves wondrous malicious , Or be accus'd of folly . I shall tell you A pretty tale : it may be you have heard it ; But , since it serves my purpose , I will venture To scale't a little more . Well , I'll hear it , sir ; yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale ; but , an't please you , deliver . There was a time when all the body's members Rebell'd against the belly ; thus accus'd it : That only like a gulf it did remain I' the midst o' the body , idle and unactive , Still cupboarding the viand , never bearing Like labour with the rest , where the other instruments Did see and hear , devise , instruct , walk , feel , And , mutually participate , did minister Unto the appetite and affection common Of the whole body . The belly answer'd , Well , sir , what answer made the belly ? Sir , I shall tell you .With a kind of smile , Which ne'er came from the lungs , but even thus For , look you , I may make the belly smile As well as speak it tauntingly replied To the discontented members , the mutinous parts That envied his receipt ; even so most fitly As you malign our senators for that They are not such as you . Your belly's answer ? What ! The kingly crowned head , the vigilant eye , The counsellor heart , the arm our soldier , Our steed the leg , the tongue our trumpeter , With other muniments and petty helps In this our fabric , if that they What then ? 'Fore me , this fellow speaks ! what then ? what then ? Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd , Who is the sink o' the body , Well , what then ? The former agents , if they did complain , What could the belly answer ? I will tell you ; If you'll bestow a small , of what you have little , Patience a while , you'll hear the belly's answer . You're long about it . Note me this , good friend ; Your most grave belly was deliberate , Not rash like his accusers , and thus answer'd : 'True is it , my incorporate friends ,' quoth he , 'That I receive the general food at first , Which you do live upon ; and fit it is ; Because I am the store-house and the shop Of the whole body : but , if you do remember , I send it through the rivers of your blood , Even to the court , the heart , to the seat o' the brain ; And , through the cranks and offices of man , The strongest nerves and small inferior veins From me receive that natural competency Whereby they live . And though that all at once , You , my good friends ,' this says the belly , mark me , Ay , sir ; well , well . 'Though all at once cannot See what I do deliver out to each , Yet I can make my audit up , that all From me do back receive the flour of all , And leave me but the bran .' What say you to't ? It was an answer : how apply you this ? The senators of Rome are this good belly , And you the mutinous members ; for , examine Their counsels and their cares , digest things rightly Touching the weal o' the common , you shall find No public benefit which you receive But it proceeds or comes from them to you , And no way from yourselves . What do you think , You , the great toe of this assembly ? I the great toe ? Why the great toe ? For that , being one o' the lowest , basest , poorest , Of this most wise rebellion , thou go'st foremost : Thou rascal , that art worst in blood to run , Lead'st first to win some vantage . But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs : Rome and her rats are at the point of battle ; The one side must have bale . Hail , noble Marcius ! Thanks .What's the matter , you dissentious rogues , That , rubbing the poor itch of your opinion , Make yourselves scabs ? We have ever your good word . He that will give good words to thee will flatter Beneath abhorring . What would you have , you curs , That like nor peace nor war ? the one affrights you , The other makes you proud . He that trusts to you , Where he should find you lions , finds you hares ; Where foxes , geese : you are no surer , no , Than is the coal of fire upon the ice , Or hailstone in the sun . Your virtue is , To make him worthy whose offence subdues him , And curse that justice did it . Who deserves greatness Deserves your hate ; and your affections are A sick man's appetite , who desires most that Which would increase his evil . He that depends Upon your favours swims with fins of lead And hews down oaks with rushes . Hang ye ! Trust ye ? With every minute you do change a mind , And call him noble that was now your hate , Him vile that was your garland . What's the matter , That in these several places of the city You cry against the noble senate , who , Under the gods , keep you in awe , which else Would feed on one another ? What's their seeking ? For corn at their own rates ; whereof they say The city is well stor'd . Hang 'em ! They say ! They'll sit by the fire , and presume to know What's done i' the Capitol ; who's like to rise , Who thrives , and who declines ; side factions , and give out Conjectural marriages ; making parties strong , And feebling such as stand not in their liking , Below their cobbled shoes . They say there's grain enough ! Would the nobility lay aside their ruth , And let me use my sword , I'd make a quarry With thousands of these quarter'd slaves , as high As I could pick my lance . Nay , these are almost thoroughly persuaded ; For though abundantly they lack discretion , Yet are they passing cowardly . But , I beseech you , What says the other troop ? They are dissolv'd : hang 'em ! They said they were an-hungry ; sigh'd forth proverbs : That hunger broke stone walls ; that dogs must eat ; That meat was made for mouths ; that the gods sent not Corn for the rich men only . With these shreds They vented their complainings ; which being answer'd , And a petition granted them , a strange one , To break the heart of generosity , And make bold power look pale ,they threw their caps As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon , Shouting their emulation . What is granted them ? Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms , Of their own choice : one's Junius Brutus , Sicinius Velutus , and I know not 'Sdeath ! The rabble should have first unroof'd the city , Ere so prevail'd with me ; it will in time Win upon power , and throw forth greater themes For insurrection's arguing . This is strange . Go ; get you home , you fragments ! Where's Caius Marcius ? Here : what's the matter ? The news is , sir , the Volsces are in arms . I am glad on't ; then we shall ha' means to vent Our musty superfluity . See , our best elders . Marcius , 'tis true that you have lately told us ; The Volsces are in arms . They have a leader , Tullus Aufidius , that will put you to't . I sin in envying his nobility , And were I anything but what I am , I would wish me only he . You have fought together . Were half to half the world by the ears , and he Upon my party , I'd revolt , to make Only my wars with him : he is a lion That I am proud to hunt . Then , worthy Marcius , Attend upon Cominius to these wars . It is your former promise . Sir , it is ; And I am constant . Titus Lartius , thou Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face . What ! art thou stiff ? stand'st out ? No , Caius Marcius ; I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other , Ere stay behind this business . O ! true-bred . Your company to the Capitol ; where I know Our greatest friends attend us . Lead you on : Follow Cominius ; we must follow you ; Right worthy you priority . Noble Marcius ! Hence ! to your homes ! be gone . Nay , let them follow : The Volsces have much corn ; take these rats thither To gnaw their garners . Worshipful mutiners , Your valour puts well forth ; pray , follow . Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius ? He has no equal . When we were chosen tribunes for the people , Mark'd you his lip and eyes ? Nay , but his taunts . Being mov'd , he will not spare to gird the gods . Bemock the modest moon . The present wars devour him ; he is grown Too proud to be so valiant . Such a nature , Tickled with good success , disdains the shadow Which he treads on at noon . But I do wonder His insolence can brook to be commanded Under Cominius . Fame , at the which he aims , In whom already he is well grac'd , cannot Better be held nor more attain'd than by A place below the first ; for what miscarries Shall be the general's fault , though he perform To the utmost of a man ; and giddy censure Will then cry out of Marcius 'O ! if he Had borne the business .' Besides , if things go well , Opinion , that so sticks on Marcius , shall Of his demerits rob Cominius . Come : Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius , Though Marcius earn'd them not ; and all his faults To Marcius shall be honours , though indeed In aught he merit not . Let's hence and hear How the dispatch is made ; and in what fashion , More than his singularity , he goes Upon this present action . Let's along . So , your opinion is , Aufidius , That they of Rome are enter'd in our counsels , And know how we proceed . Is it not yours ? What ever have been thought on in this state , That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome Had circumvention ? 'Tis not four days gone Since I heard thence ; these are the words : I think I have the letter here ; yes , here it is . They have press'd a power , but it is not known Whether for east , or west : the dearth is great ; The people mutinous ; and it is rumour'd , Cominius , Marcius , your old enemy , Who is of Rome worse hated than of you , And Titus Lartius , a most valiant Roman , These three lead on this preparation Whither 'tis bent : most likely 'tis for you : Consider of it . Our army's in the field : We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready To answer us . Nor did you think it folly To keep your great pretences veil'd till when They needs must show themselves ; which in the hatching , It seem'd , appear'd to Rome . By the discovery We shall be shorten'd in our aim , which was To take in many towns ere almost Rome Should know we were afoot . Noble Aufidius , Take your commission ; hie you to your bands ; Let us alone to guard Corioli : If they set down before's , for the remove Bring up your army ; but , I think you'll find They've not prepared for us . O ! doubt not that ; I speak from certainties . Nay , more ; Some parcels of their power are forth already , And only hitherward . I leave your honours . If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet , 'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike Till one can do no more . The gods assist you ! And keep your honours safe ! Farewell . Farewell . Farewell . I pray you , daughter , sing ; or express yourself in a more comfortable sort . If my son were my husband , I would freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love . When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb , when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way , when for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding , I , considering how honour would become such a person , that it was no better than picture-like to hang by the wall , if renown made it not stir , was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame . To a cruel war I sent him ; from whence he returned , his brows bound with oak . I tell thee , daughter , I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man . But had he died in the business , madam ; how then ? Then , his good report should have been my son ; I therein would have found issue . Hear me profess sincerely : had I a dozen sons , each in my love alike , and none less dear than thine and my good Marcius , I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action . Madam , the Lady Valeria is come to visit you . Beseech you , give me leave to retire myself . Indeed , you shall not . Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum , See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair , As children from a bear , the Volsces shunning him : Methinks I see him stamp thus , and call thus : 'Come on , you cowards ! you were got in fear , Though you were born in Rome .' His bloody brow With his mail'd hand then wiping , forth he goes , Like to a harvestman that's task'd to mow Or all or lose his hire . His bloody brow ! O Jupiter ! no blood . Away , you fool ! it more becomes a man Than gilt his trophy : the breasts of Hecuba , When she did suckle Hector , look'd not lovelier Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood At Grecian swords , contemning . Tell Valeria We are fit to bid her welcome . Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius ! He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee , And tread upon his neck . My ladies both , good day to you . Sweet madam . I am glad to see your ladyship . How do you both ? you are manifest housekeepers . What are you sewing here ? A fine spot , in good faith . How does your little son ? I thank your ladyship ; well , good madam . He had rather see the swords and hear a drum , than look upon his schoolmaster . O' my word , the father's son ; I'll swear 'tis a very pretty boy . O' my troth , I looked upon him o' Wednesday half an hour together : he has such a confirmed countenance . I saw him run after a gilded butterfly ; and when he caught it , he let it go again ; and after it again ; and over and over he comes , and up again ; catched it again : or whether his fall enraged him , or how 'twas , he did so set his teeth and tear it ; O ! I warrant , how he mammocked it ! One on's father's moods . Indeed , la , 'tis a noble child . A crack , madam . Come , lay aside your stitchery ; I must have you play the idle huswife with me this afternoon . No , good madam ; I will not out of doors . Not out of doors ! She shall , she shall . Indeed , no , by your patience ; I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars . Fie ! you confine yourself most unreasonably . Come ; you must go visit the good lady that lies in . I will wish her speedy strength , and visit her with my prayers ; but I cannot go thither . Why , I pray you ? 'Tis not to save labour , nor that I want love . You would be another Penelope ; yet , they say , all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths . Come ; I would your cambric were sensible as your finger , that you might leave pricking it for pity . Come , you shall go with us . No , good madam , pardon me ; indeed , I will not forth . In truth , la , go with me ; and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband . O , good madam , there can be none yet . Verily , I do not jest with you ; there came news from him last night . Indeed , madam ? In earnest , it's true ; I heard a senator speak it . Thus it is : The Volsces have an army forth ; against whom Cominius the general is gone , with one part of our Roman power : your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli ; they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars . This is true , on mine honour ; and so , I pray , go with us . Give me excuse , good madam ; I will obey you in every thing hereafter . Let her alone , lady : as she is now she will but disease our better mirth . In troth , I think she would . Fare you well then . Come , good sweet lady . Prithee , Virgilia , turn thy solemness out o' door , and go along with us . No , at a word , madam ; indeed I must not . I wish you much mirth . Well then , farewell . Yonder comes news : a wager they have met . My horse to yours , no . 'Tis done . Agreed . Say , has our general met the enemy ? They lie in view , but have not spoke as yet . So the good horse is mine . I'll buy him of you . No , I'll nor sell nor give him ; lend you him I will For half a hundred years . Summon the town . How far off lie these armies ? Within this mile and half . Then shall we hear their 'larum , and they ours . Now , Mars , I prithee , make us quick in work , That we with smoking swords may march from hence , To help our fielded friends ! Come , blow thy blast . Tullus Aufidius , is he within your walls ? No , nor a man that fears you less than he , That's lesser than a little . Hark , our drums Are bringing forth our youth : we'll break our walls , Rather than they shall pound us up : our gates , Which yet seem shut , we have but pinn'd with rushes ; They'll open of themselves . Hark you , far off ! There is Aufidius : list , what work he makes Amongst your cloven army . O ! they are at it ! Their noise be our instruction . Ladders , ho ! They fear us not , but issue forth their city . Now put your shields before your hearts , and fight With hearts more proof than shields . Advance , brave Titus : They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts , Which makes me sweat with wrath . Come on , my fellows : He that retires , I'll take him for a Volsce , And he shall feel mine edge . All the contagion of the south light on you , You shames of Rome ! you herd of Boils and plagues Plaster you o'er , that you may be abhorr'd Further than seen , and one infect another Against the wind a mile ! You souls of geese , That bear the shapes of men , how have you run From slaves that apes would beat ! Pluto and hell ! All hurt behind ; backs red , and faces pale With flight and agu'd fear ! Mend and charge home , Or , by the fires of heaven , I'll leave the foe And make my wars on you ; look to 't : come on ; If you'll stand fast , we'll beat them to their wives , As they us to our trenches follow'd . So , now the gates are ope : now prove good seconds : 'Tis for the followers Fortune widens them , Not for the fliers : mark me , and do the like . Foolhardiness ! not I . Nor I . See , they have shut him in . To the pot , I warrant him . What is become of Marcius ? Slain , sir , doubtless . Following the fliers at the very heels , With them he enters ; who , upon the sudden , Clapp'd-to their gates ; he is himself alone , To answer all the city . O noble fellow ! Who , sensibly , outdares his senseless sword , And , when it bows , stands up . Thou art left , Marcius : A carbuncle entire , as big as thou art , Were not so rich a jewel . Thou wast a soldier Even to Cato's wish , not fierce and terrible Only in strokes ; but , with thy grim looks and The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds , Thou mad'st thine enemies shake , as if the world Were feverous and did tremble . Look , sir ! O ! 'tis Marcius ! Let's fetch him off , or make remain alike . This will I carry to Rome . And I this . A murrain on't ! I took this for silver . See here these movers that do prize their hours At a crack'd drachme ! Cushions , leaden spoons , Irons of a doit , doublets that hangmen would Bury with those that wore them , these base slaves , Ere yet the fight be done , pack up . Down with them ! And hark , what noise the general makes ! To him ! There is the man of my soul's hate , Aufidius , Piercing our Romans : then , valiant Titus , take Convenient numbers to make good the city , Whilst I , with those that have the spirit , will haste To help Cominius . Worthy sir , thou bleed'st ; Thy exercise hath been too violent For a second course of fight . Sir , praise me not ; My work hath yet not warm'd me : fare you well : The blood I drop is rather physical Than dangerous to me : to Aufidius thus I will appear , and fight . Now the fair goddess , Fortune , Fall deep in love with thee ; and her great charms Misguide thy opposers' swords ! Bold gentleman , Prosperity be thy page ! Thy friend no less Than those she places highest ! So , farewell . Thou worthiest Marcius ! Go , sound thy trumpet in the market-place ; Call thither all the officers of the town , Where they shall know our mind . Away ! Breathe you , my friends : well fought ; we are come off Like Romans , neither foolish in our stands , Nor cowardly in retire : believe me , sirs , We shall be charg'd again . Whiles we have struck , By interims and conveying gusts we have heard The charges of our friends . Ye Roman gods ! Lead their successes as we wish our own , That both our powers , with smiling fronts encountering , May give you thankful sacrifice . Thy news ? The citizens of Corioli have issu'd , And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle : I saw our party to their trenches driven , And then I came away . Though thou speak'st truth , Methinks thou speak'st not well . How long is't since ? Above an hour , my lord . 'Tis not a mile ; briefly we heard their drums : How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour , And bring thy news so late ? Spies of the Volsces Held me in chase , that I was forc'd to wheel Three or four miles about ; else had I , sir , Half an hour since brought my report . Who's yonder , That does appear as he were flay'd ? O gods ! He has the stamp of Marcius ; and I have Before-time seen him thus . Come I too late ? The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor , More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue From every meaner man . Come I too late ? Ay , if you come not in the blood of others , But mantled in your own . O ! let me clip ye In arms as sound as when I woo'd , in heart As merry as when our nuptial day was done , And tapers burn'd to bedward . Flower of warriors . How is't with Titus Lartius ? As with a man busied about decrees : Condemning some to death , and some to exile ; Ransoming him , or pitying , threat'ning the other ; Holding Corioli in the name of Rome , Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash , To let him slip at will . Where is that slave Which told me they had beat you to your trenches ? Where is he ? Call him hither . Let him alone ; He did inform the truth : but for our gentlemen , The common file a plague ! tribunes for them ! The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge From rascals worse than they . But how prevail'd you ? Will the time serve to tell ? I do not think . Where is the enemy ? Are you lords o' the field ? If not , why cease you till you are so ? Marcius , we have at disadvantage fought , And did retire to win our purpose . How lies their battle ? Know you on which side They have plac'd their men of trust ? As I guess , Marcius , Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates , Of their best trust ; o'er them Aufidius , Their very heart of hope . I do beseech you , By all the battles wherein we have fought , By the blood we have shed together , by the vows We have made to endure friends , that you directly Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates ; And that you not delay the present , but , Filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts , We prove this very hour . Though I could wish You were conducted to a gentle bath , And balms applied to you , yet dare I never Deny your asking : take your choice of those That best can aid your action . Those are they That most are willing . If any such be here As it were sin to doubt that love this painting Wherein you see me smear'd ; if any fear Lesser his person than an ill report ; If any think brave death outweighs bad life , And that his country's dearer than himself ; Let him , alone , or so many so minded , Wave thus , to express his disposition , And follow Marcius . O ! me alone ? Make you a sword of me ? If these shows be not outward , which of you But is four Volsces ? None of you but is Able to bear against the great Aufidius A shield as hard as his . A certain number , Though thanks to all , must I select from all : the rest Shall bear the business in some other fight , As cause will be obey'd . Please you to march ; And four shall quickly draw out my command , Which men are best inclin'd . March on , my fellows : Make good this ostentation , and you shall Divide in all with us . So ; let the ports be guarded : keep your duties , As I have set them down . If I do send , dispatch Those centuries to our aid ; the rest will serve For a short holding : if we lose the field , We cannot keep the town . Fear not our care , sir . Hence , and shut your gates upon us . Our guider , come ; to the Roman camp conduct us . I'll fight with none but thee ; for I do hate thee Worse than a promise-breaker . We hate alike : Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor More than thy fame and envy . Fix thy foot . Let the first budger die the other's slave , And the gods doom him after ! If I fly , Marcius , Halloo me like a hare . Within these three hours , Tullus , Alone I fought in your Corioli walls , And made what work I pleas'd ; 'tis not my blood Wherein thou seest me mask'd ; for thy revenge Wrench up thy power to the highest . Wert thou the Hector That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny , Thou shouldst not 'scape me here . Officious , and not valiant , you have sham'd me In your condemned seconds . If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work , Thou'lt not believe thy deeds : but I'll report it Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles , Where great patricians shall attend and shrug , I' the end , admire ; where ladies shall be frighted , And , gladly quak'd , hear more ; where the dull Tribunes , That , with the fusty plebeians , hate thine honours , Shall say , against their hearts , 'We thank the gods our Rome hath such a soldier !' Yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast , Having fully din'd before . O general , Here is the steed , we the caparison : Hadst thou beheld Pray now , no more : my mother , Who has a charter to extol her blood , When she does praise me grieves me . I have done As you have done ; that's what I can ; induc'd As you have been ; that's for my country : He that has but effected his good will Hath overta'en mine act . You shall not be The grave of your deserving ; Rome must know The value of her own : 'twere a concealment Worse than a theft , no less than a traducement , To hide your doings ; and to silence that , Which , to the spire and top of praises vouch'd , Would seem but modest . Therefore , I beseech you , In sign of what you are , not to reward What you have done ,before our army hear me . I have some wounds upon me , and they smart To hear themselves remember'd . Should they not . Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude , And tent themselves with death . Of all the horses , Whereof we have ta'en good , and good store , of all The treasure , in this field achiev'd and city , We render you the tenth ; to be ta'en forth , Before the common distribution , At your only choice . I thank you , general ; But cannot make my heart consent to take A bribe to pay my sword : I do refuse it ; And stand upon my common part with those That have beheld the doing . May these same instruments , which you profane , Never sound more ! When drums and trumpets shall I' the field prove flatterers , let courts and cities be Made all of false-fac'd soothing ! When steel grows soft as is the parasite's silk , Let him be made a coverture for the wars ! No more , I say ! For that I have not wash'd My nose that bled , or foil'd some debile wretch , Which , without note , here's many else have done , You shout me forth In acclamations hyperbolical ; As if I lov'd my little should be dieted In praises sauc'd with lies . Too modest are you ; More cruel to your good report than grateful To us that give you truly . By your patience , If 'gainst yourself you be incens'd , we'll put you , Like one that means his proper harm , in manacles , Then reason safely with you . Therefore , be it known , As to us , to all the world , that Caius Marcius Wears this war's garland ; in token of the which , My noble steed , known to the camp , I give him , With all his trim belonging ; and from this time , For what he did before Corioli , call him , With all the applause and clamour of the host , The addition nobly ever ! Caius Marcius Coriolanus ! I will go wash ; And when my face is fair , you shall perceive Whether I blush , or no : howbeit , I thank you . I mean to stride your steed , and at all times To undercrest your good addition To the fairness of my power . So , to our tent ; Where , ere we do repose us , we will write To Rome of our success . You , Titus Lartius , Must to Corioli back : send us to Rome The best , with whom we may articulate , For their own good and ours . I shall , my lord . The gods begin to mock me . I , that now Refus'd most princely gifts , am bound to beg Of my lord general . Take it ; 'tis yours . What is't ? I sometime lay here in Corioli At a poor man's house ; he us'd me kindly : He cried to me ; I saw him prisoner ; But then Aufidius was within my view , And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity : I request you To give my poor host freedom . O ! well begg'd ! Were he the butcher of my son , he should Be free as is the wind . Deliver him , Titus . Marcius , his name ? By Jupiter ! forgot . I am weary ; yea , my memory is tir'd . Have we no wine here ? Go we to our tent : The blood upon your visage dries ; 'tis time It should be look'd to : come . The town is ta'en ! 'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition . Condition ! I would I were a Roman ; for I cannot , Being a Volsce , be that I am . Condition ! What good condition can a treaty find I' the part that is at mercy ? Five times , Marcius , I have fought with thee ; so often hast thou beat me , And wouldst do so , I think , should we encounter As often as we eat . By the elements , If e'er again I meet him beard to beard , He is mine , or I am his : mine emulation Hath not that honour in't it had ; for where I thought to crush him in an equal force True sword to sword I'll potch at him some way Or wrath or craft may get him . He's the devil . Bolder , though not so subtle . My valour's poison'd With only suffering stain by him ; for him Shall fly out of itself . Nor sleep nor sanctuary , Being naked , sick , nor fane nor Capitol , The prayers of priests , nor times of sacrifice , Embarquements all of fury , shall lift up Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst My hate to Marcius . Where I find him , were it At home , upon my brother's guard , even there Against the hospitable canon , would I Wash my fierce hand in 's heart . Go you to the city ; Learn how 'tis held , and what they are that must Be hostages for Rome . Will not you go ? I am attended at the cypress grove : I pray you 'Tis south the city mills bring me word thither How the world goes , that to the pace of it I may spur on my journey . I shall , sir . The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night . Good or bad ? Not according to the prayer of the people , for they love not Marcius . Nature teaches beasts to know their friends . Pray you , who does the wolf love ? The lamb . Ay , to devour him ; as the hungry plebeians would the noble Marcius . He's a lamb indeed , that baes like a bear . He's a bear indeed , that lives like a lamb . You two are old men ; tell me one thing that I shall ask you . Well , sir . Well , sir . In what enormity is Marcius poor in , that you two have not in abundance ? He's poor in no one fault , but stored with all . Especially in pride . And topping all others in boasting . This is strange now : do you two know how you are censured here in the city , I mean of us o' the right hand file ? Do you ? Why , how are we censured ? Because you talk of pride now ,Will you not be angry ? Well , well , sir ; well . Why , 'tis no great matter ; for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience : give your dispositions the reins , and be angry at your pleasures ; at the least , if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so . You blame Marcius for being proud ? We do it not alone , sir . I know you can do very little alone ; for your helps are many , or else your actions would grow wondrous single : your abilities are too infant-like , for doing much alone . You talk of pride : O ! that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks , and make but an interior survey of your good selves . O ! that you could . What then , sir ? Why , then you should discover a brace of unmeriting , proud , violent , testy magistrates alias fools as any in Rome . Menenius , you are known well enough too . I am known to be a humorous patrician , and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't ; said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint ; hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion ; one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning . What I think I utter , and spend my malice in my breath . Meeting two such wealsmen as you are ,I cannot call you Lycurguses ,if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely , I make a crooked face at it . I cannot say your worships have delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables ; and though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men , yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces . If you see this in the map of my microcosm , follows it that I am known well enough too ? What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character , if I be known well enough too ? Come , sir , come , we know you well enough . You know neither me , yourselves , nor anything . You are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs : you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and a fosset-seller , and then rejourn the controversy of three-pence to a second day of audience . When you are hearing a matter between party and party , if you chance to be pinched with the colic , you make faces like mummers , set up the bloody flag against all patience , and , in roaring for a chamber-pot , dismiss the controversy bleeding , the more entangled by your hearing : all the peace you make in their cause is , calling both the parties knaves . You are a pair of strange ones . Come , come , you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol . Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are . When you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards ; and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's cushion , or to be entombed in an ass's pack-saddle . Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud ; who , in a cheap estimation , is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion , though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary hangmen . Good den to your worships : more of your conversation would infect my brain , being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians : I will be bold to take my leave of you . How now , my as fair as noble ladies ,and the moon , were she earthly , no nobler ,whither do you follow your eyes so fast ? Honourable Menenius , my boy Marcius approaches ; for the love of Juno , let's go . Ha ! Marcius coming home ? Ay , worthy Menenius ; and with most prosperous approbation . Take my cap , Jupiter , and I thank thee . Hoo ! Marcius coming home ! Nay , 'tis true . Nay , 'tis true . Look , here's a letter from him : the state hath another , his wife another ; and , I think , there's one at home for you . I will make my very house reel to-night . A letter for me ! Yes , certain , there's a letter for you ; I saw it . A letter for me ! It gives me an estate of seven years' health ; in which time I will make a lip at the physician : the most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic , and , to this preservative , of no better report than a horse-drench . Is he not wounded ? he was wont to come home wounded . O ! no , no , no . O ! he is wounded , I thank the gods for't . So do I too , if it be not too much . Brings a' victory in his pocket ? The wounds become him . On 's brows , Menenius ; he comes the third time home with the oaken garland . Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly ? Titus Lartius writes they fought together , but Aufidius got off . And 'twas time for him too , I'll warrant him that : an he had stayed by him I would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in Corioli , and the gold that's in them . Is the senate possessed of this ? Good ladies , let's go . Yes , yes , yes ; the senate has letters from the general , wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war . He hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly . In troth there's wondrous things spoke of him . Wondrous ! ay , I warrant you , and not without his true purchasing . The gods grant them true ! True ! pow , wow . True ! I'll be sworn they are true . Where is he wounded ? Where is he wounded ? I' the shoulder , and i' the left arm : there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place . He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i' the body . One i' the neck , and two i' the thigh , there's nine that I know . He had , before this last expedition , twenty-five wounds upon him . Now , it's twenty-seven : every gash was an enemy's grave . Hark ! the trumpets . These are the ushers of Marcius : before him he carries noise , and behind him he leaves tears : Death , that dark spirit , in 's nervy arm doth lie ; Which , being advanc'd , declines , and then men die . Know , Rome , that all alone Marcius did fight Within Corioli gates : where he hath won , With fame , a name to Caius Marcius ; these In honour follows Coriolanus . Welcome to Rome , renowned Coriolanus ! Welcome to Rome , renowned Coriolanus ! No more of this ; it does offend my heart : Pray now , no more . Look , sir , your mother !
