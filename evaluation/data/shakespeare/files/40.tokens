The scars upon your honour therefore he Does pity , as constrained blemishes , Not as deserv'd . He is a god , and knows What is most right . Mine honour was not yielded , But conquer'd merely . To be sure of that , I will ask Antony . Sir , sir , thou'rt so leaky , That we must leave thee to thy sinking , for Thy dearest quit thee . Shall I say to C sar What you require of him ? for he partly begs To be desir'd to give . It much would please him , That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon ; but it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony , And put yourself under his shroud , The universal landlord . What's your name ? My name is Thyreus . Most kind messenger , Say to great C sar this : in deputation I kiss his conqu'ring hand ; tell him , I am prompt To lay my crown at 's feet , and there to kneel ; Tell him , from his all-obeying breath I hear The doom of Egypt . 'Tis your noblest course . Wisdom and fortune combating together , If that the former dare but what it can , No chance may shake it . Give me grace to lay My duty on your hand . Your C sar's father oft , When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in , Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place , As it rain'd kisses . Favours , by Jove that thunders ! What art thou , fellow ? One that but performs The bidding of the fullest man , and worthiest To have command obey'd . You will be whipp'd . Approach there ! Ah , you kite ! Now , gods and devils ! Authority melts from me : of late , when I cried 'Ho !' Like boys unto a muss , kings would start forth , And cry , 'Your will ?' Have you no ears ? I am Antony yet . Take hence this Jack and whip him . 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp Than with an old one dying . Moon and stars ! Whip him . Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge C sar , should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here , what's her name , Since she was Cleopatra ? Whip him , fellows , Till , like a boy , you see him cringe his face And whine aloud for mercy ; take him hence . Mark Antony , Tug him away ; being whipp'd , Bring him again ; this Jack of C sar's shall Bear us an errand to him . You were half blasted ere I knew you : ha ! Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome , Forborne the getting of a lawful race , And by a gem of women , to be abus'd By one that looks on feeders ? Good my lord , You have been a boggler ever : But when we in our viciousness grow hard , O misery on 't !the wise gods seel our eyes ; In our own filth drop our clear judgments ; make us Adore our errors ; laugh at 's while we strut To our confusion . O ! is't come to this ? I found you as a morsel , cold upon Dead C sar's trencher ; nay , you were a fragment Of Cneius Pompey's ; besides what hotter hours , Unregister'd in vulgar fame , you have Luxuriously pick'd out ; for , I am sure , Though you can guess what temperance should be , You know not what it is . Wherefore is this ? To let a fellow that will take rewards And say 'God quit you !' be familiar with My playfellow , your hand ; this kingly seal And plighter of high hearts . O ! that I were Upon the hill of Basan , to outroar The horned herd ; for I have savage cause ; And to proclaim it civilly were like A halter'd neck , which does the hangman thank For being yare about him . Is he whipp'd ? Soundly , my lord . Cried he ? and begg'd a' pardon ? He did ask favour . If that thy father live , let him repent Thou wast not made his daughter ; and be thou sorry To follow C sar in his triumph , since Thou hast been whipp'd for following him : henceforth , The white hand of a lady fever thee , Shake thou to look on 't . Get thee back to C sar , Tell him thy entertainment ; look , thou say He makes me angry with him ; for he seems Proud and disdainful , harping on what I am , Not what he knew I was : he makes me angry ; And at this time most easy 'tis to do 't , When my good stars , that were my former guides , Have empty left their orbs , and shot their fires Into the abysm of hell . If he mislike My speech and what is done , tell him he has Hipparchus , my enfranched bondman , whom He may at pleasure whip , or hang , or torture , As he shall like , to quit me : urge it thou : Hence with thy stripes ; be gone ! Have you done yet ? Alack ! our terrene moon Is now eclips'd ; and it portends alone The fall of Antony . I must stay his time . To flatter C sar , would you mingle eyes With one that ties his points ? Not know me yet ? Cold-hearted toward me ? Ah ! dear , if I be so , From my cold heart let heaven engender hail , And poison it in the source ; and the first stone Drop in my neck : as it determines , so Dissolve my life . The next C sarion smite , Till by degrees the memory of my womb , Together with my brave Egyptians all , By the discandying of this pelleted storm , Lie graveless , till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey ! I am satisfied . C sar sits down in Alexandria , where I will oppose his fate . Our force by land Hath nobly held ; our sever'd navy too Have knit again , and fleet , threat'ning most sea-like . Where hast thou been , my heart ? Dost thou hear , lady ? If from the field I shall return once more To kiss these lips , I will appear in blood ; I and my sword will earn our chronicle : There's hope in 't yet . That's my brave lord ! I will betreble-sinew'd , hearted , breath'd , And fight maliciously ; for when mine hours Were nice and lucky , men did ransom lives Of me for jests ; but now I'll set my teeth , And send to darkness all that stop me . Come , Let's have one other gaudy night : call to me All my sad captains ; fill our bowls once more ; Let's mock the midnight bell . It is my birth-day : I had thought to have held it poor ; but , since my lord Is Antony again , I will be Cleopatra . We will yet do well . Call all his noble captains to my lord . Do so , we'll speak to them ; and to-night I'll force The wine peep through their scars . Come on , my queen ; There's sap in 't yet . The next time I do fight I'll make death love me , for I will contend Even with his pestilent scythe . Now he'll outstare the lightning . To be furious Is to be frighted out of fear , and in that mood The dove will peck the estridge ; and I see still , A diminution in our captain's brain Restores his heart . When valour preys on reason It eats the sword it fights with . I will seek Some way to leave him . He calls me boy , and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt ; my messenger He hath whipp'd with rods ; dares me to personal combat , C sar to Antony . Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die ; meantime Laugh at his challenge . C sar must think , When one so great begins to rage , he's hunted Even to falling . Give him no breath , but now Make boot of his distraction : never anger Made good guard for itself . Let our best heads Know that to-morrow the last of many battles We mean to fight . Within our files there are , Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late , Enough to fetch him in . See it done ; And feast the army ; we have store to do 't , And they have earn'd the waste . Poor Antony ! He will not fight with me , Domitius . No . Why should he not ? He thinks , being twenty times of better fortune , He is twenty men to one . To-morrow , soldier , By sea and land I'll fight : or I will live , Or bathe my dying honour in the blood Shall make it live again . Woo't thou fight well ? I'll strike , and cry , 'Take all .' Well said ; come on . Call forth my household servants ; let's to-night Be bounteous at our meal . Give me thy hand , Thou hast been rightly honest ; so hast thou ; Thou ; and thou , and thou : you have serv'd me well , And kings have been your fellows . What means this ? 'Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots Out of the mind . And thou art honest too . I wish I could be made so many men , And all of you clapp'd up together in An Antony , that I might do you service So good as you have done . The gods forbid ! Well , my good fellows , wait on me to-night , Scant not my cups , and make as much of me As when mine empire was your fellow too , And suffer'd my command . What does he mean ? To make his followers weep . Tend me to-night ; May be it is the period of your duty : Haply , you shall not see me more ; or if , A mangled shadow : perchance to-morrow You'll serve another master . I look on you As one that takes his leave . Mine honest friends , I turn you not away ; but , like a master Married to your good service , stay till death . Tend me to-night two hours , I ask no more , And the gods yield you for 't ! What mean you , sir , To give them this discomfort ? Look , they weep ; And I , an ass , am onion-ey'd : for shame , Transform us not to women . Ho , ho , ho ! Now , the witch take me , if I meant it thus ! Grace grow where those drops fall ! My hearty friends , You take me in too dolorous a sense , For I spake to you for your comfort ; did desire you To burn this night with torches . Know , my hearts , I hope well of to-morrow ; and will lead you Where rather I'll expect victorious life Than death and honour . Let's to supper , come , And drown consideration . Brother , good night ; to-morrow is the day . It will determine one way ; fare you well . Heard you of nothing strange about the streets ? Nothing . What news ? Belike , 'tis but a rumour . Good night to you . Well , sir , good night . Soldiers , have careful watch . And you . Good night , good night . Here we : And if to-morrow Our navy thrive , I have an absolute hope Our landmen will stand up . 'Tis a brave army , And full of purpose . Peace ! what noise ? List , list ! Hark ! Music i' the air . Under the earth . It signs well , does it not ? No . Peace , I say ! What should this mean ? 'Tis the god Hercules , whom Antony lov'd , Now leaves him . Walk ; let's see if other watchmen Do hear what we do . How now , masters ! How now ! How now !do you hear this ? Ay ; is 't not strange ? Do you hear , masters ? do you hear ? Follow the noise so far as we have quarter ; Let's see how 't will give off . Content .'Tis strange . Eros ! mine armour , Eros ! Sleep a little . No , my chuck . Eros , come ; mine armour , Eros ! Come , good fellow , put mine iron on : If Fortune be not ours to-day , it is Because we brave her . Come . Nay , I'll help too . What's this for ? Ah ! let be , let be ; thou art The armourer of my heart : false , false ; this , this . Sooth , la ! I'll help : thus it must be . Well , well ; We shall thrive now . Seest thou , my good fellow ? Go put on thy defences . Briefly , sir . Is not this buckled well ? Rarely , rarely : He that unbuckles this , till we do please To daff 't for our repose , shall hear a storm . Thou fumblest , Eros ; and my queen's a squire More tight at this than thou : dispatch . O love ! That thou couldst see my wars to-day , and knew'st The royal occupation , thou shouldst see A workman in 't . Good morrow to thee ; welcome ; Thou look'st like him that knows a war-like charge : To business that we love we rise betime , And go to 't with delight . A thousand , sir , Early though 't be , have on their riveted trim , And at the port expect you . The morn is fair . Good morrow , general . Good morrow , general . 'Tis well blown , lads . This morning , like the spirit of a youth That means to be of note , begins betimes . So , so ; come , give me that : this way ; well said . Fare thee well , dame , whate'er becomes of me ; This is a soldier's kiss . Rebukeable And worthy shameful check it were , to stand On more mechanic compliment ; I'll leave thee Now , like a man of steel . You that will fight , Follow me close ; I'll bring you to 't . Adieu . Please you , retire to your chamber . Lead me . He goes forth gallantly . That he and C sar might Determine this great war in single fight ! Then , Antony ,but now .Well , on . The gods make this a happy day to Antony ! Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd To make me fight at land ! Hadst thou done so , The kings that have revolted , and the soldier That has this morning left thee , would have still Follow'd thy heels . Who's gone this morning ? Who ! One ever near thee : call for Enobarbus , He shall not hear thee ; or from C sar's camp Say , 'I am none of thine .' What sayst thou ? Sir , He is with C sar . Sir , his chests and treasure He has not with him . Is he gone ? Most certain . Go , Eros , send his treasure after ; do it ; Detain no jot , I charge thee . Write to him I will subscribe gentle adieus and greetings ; Say that I wish he never find more cause To change a master . O ! my fortunes have Corrupted honest men . Dispatch . Enobarbus ! Go forth , Agrippa , and begin the fight : Our will is Antony be took alive ; Make it so known . C sar , I shall . The time of universal peace is near : Prove this a prosperous day , the three-nook'd world Shall bear the olive freely . Antony Is come into the field . Go charge Agrippa Plant those that have revolted in the van , That Antony may seem to spend his fury Upon himself . Alexas did revolt , and went to Jewry on Affairs of Antony ; there did persuade Great Herod to incline himself to C sar , And leave his master Antony : for this pains C sar hath hang'd him . Canidius and the rest That fell away have entertainment , but No honourable trust . I have done ill , Of which I do accuse myself so sorely That I will joy no more . Enobarbus , Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure , with His bounty overplus : the messenger Came on my guard ; and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules . I give it you . Mock not , Enobarbus . I tell you true : best you saf'd the bringer Out of the host ; I must attend mine office Or would have done 't myself . Your emperor Continues still a Jove . I am alone the villain of the earth , And feel I am so most . O Antony ! Thou mine of bounty , how wouldst thou have paid My better service , when my turpitude Thou dost so crown with gold ! This blows my heart : If swift thought break it not , a swifter mean Shall outstrike thought ; but thought will do 't , I feel . I fight against thee ! No : I will go seek Some ditch , wherein to die ; the foul'st best fits My latter part of life . Retire , we have engag'd ourselves too far . C sar himself has work , and our oppression Exceeds what we expected . O my brave emperor , this is fought indeed ! Had we done so at first , we had droven them home With clouts about their heads . Thou bleed'st apace . I had a wound here that was like a T , But now 'tis made an H . They do retire . We'll beat 'em into bench-holes : I have yet Room for six scotches more . They are beaten , sir ; and our advantage serves For a fair victory . Let us score their backs , And snatch 'em up , as we take hares , behind : 'Tis sport to maul a runner . I will reward thee Once for thy sprightly comfort , and ten-fold For thy good valour . Come thee on . I'll halt after . We have beat him to his camp ; run one before And let the queen know of our gests . To-morrow , Before the sun shall see 's , we'll spill the blood That has to-day escap'd . I thank you all ; For doughty-handed are you , and have fought Not as you serv'd the cause , but as 't had been Each man's like mine ; you have shown all Hectors . Enter the city , clip your wives , your friends , Tell them your feats ; whilst they with joyful tears Wash the congealment from your wounds , and kiss The honour'd gashes whole . Give me thy hand : To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts , Make her thanks bless thee . O thou day o' the world ! Chain mine arm'd neck ; leap thou , attire and all , Through proof of harness to my heart , and there Ride on the pants triumphing . Lord of lords ! O infinite virtue ! com'st thou smiling from The world's great snare uncaught ? My nightingale , We have beat them to their beds . What , girl ! though grey Do something mingle with our younger brown , yet ha' we A brain that nourishes our nerves , and can Get goal for goal of youth . Behold this man ; Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand : Kiss it , my warrior : he hath fought to-day As if a god , in hate of mankind , had Destroy'd in such a shape . I'll give thee , friend , An armour all of gold ; it was a king's . He has deserv'd it , were it carbuncled Like holy Ph bus' car . Give me thy hand : Through Alexandria make a jolly march ; Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them : Had our great palace the capacity To camp this host , we all would sup together And drink carouses to the next day's fate , Which promises royal peril . Trumpeters , With brazen din blast you the city's ear , Make mingle with our rattling tabourines , That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together , Applauding our approach . If we be not reliev'd within this hour , We must return to the court of guard : the night Is shiny , and they say we shall embattle By the second hour i' the morn . This last day was A shrewd one to 's . O ! bear me witness , night , What man is this ? Stand close and list him . Be witness to me , O thou blessed moon , When men revolted shall upon record Bear hateful memory , poor Enobarbus did Before thy face repent ! Enobarbus ! Peace ! Hark further . O sovereign mistress of true melancholy , The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me , That life , a very rebel to my will , May hang no longer on me ; throw my heart Against the flint and hardness of my fault , Which , being dried with grief , will break to powder , And finish all foul thoughts . O Antony ! Nobler than my revolt is infamous , Forgive me in thine own particular ; But let the world rank me in register A master-leaver and a fugitive . O Antony ! O Antony ! Let's speak to him . Let's hear him , for the things he speaks May concern C sar . Let's do so . But he sleeps . Swounds rather ; for so bad a prayer as his Was never yet for sleep . Go we to him . Awake , sir , awake ! speak to us . Hear you , sir ? The Land of death hath raught him . Hark ! the drums Demurely wake the sleepers . Let us bear him To the court of guard ; he is of note : our hour Is fully out . Come on , then ; He may recover yet . Their preparation is to-day by sea ; We please them not by land . For both , my lord . I would they'd fight i' the fire or i' the air ; We'd fight there too . But this it is ; our foot Upon the hills adjoining to the city Shall stay with us ; order for sea is given , They have put forth the haven , Where their appointment we may best discover And look on their endeavour . But being charg'd , we will be still by land , Which , as I take 't , we shall ; for his best force Is forth to man his galleys . To the vales , And hold our best advantage ! Yet they are not join'd . Where yond pine does stand I shall discover all ; I'll bring thee word Straight how 'tis like to go . Swallows have built In Cleopatra's sails their nests ; the augurers Say they know not , they cannot tell ; look grimly , And dare not speak their knowledge . Antony Is valiant , and dejected ; and , by starts , His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear Of what he has and has not . All is lost ! This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me ; My fleet hath yielded to the foe , and yonder They cast their caps up and carouse together Like friends long lost . Triple-turn'd whore ! 'tis thou Hast sold me to this novice , and my heart Makes only wars on thee . Bid them all fly ; For when I am reveng'd upon my charm , I have done all . Bid them all fly ; be gone . O sun ! thy uprise shall I see no more ; Fortune and Antony part here ; even here Do we shake hands . All come to this ? The hearts That spaniel'd me at heels , to whom I gave Their wishes , do discandy , melt their sweets On blossoming C sar ; and this pine is bark'd , That overtopp'd them all . Betray'd I am . O this false soul of Egypt ! this grave charm , Whose eyes beck'd forth my wars , and call'd them home , Whose bosom was my crownet , my chief end , Like a right gipsy , hath , at fast and loose , Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss . What , Eros ! Eros ! Ah ! thou spell . Avaunt ! Why is my lord enrag'd against his love ? Vanish , or I shall give thee thy deserving , And blemish C sar's triumph . Let him take thee , And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians ; Follow his chariot , like the greatest spot Of all thy sex ; most monster-like , be shown For poor'st diminutives , for doits ; and let Patient Octavia plough thy visage up With her prepared nails . 'Tis well thou'rt gone , If it be well to live ; but better 'twere Thou fell'st into my fury , for one death Might have prevented many . Eros , ho ! The shirt of Nessus is upon me ; teach me , Alcides , thou mine ancestor , thy rage ; Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon ; And with those hands , that grasp'd the heaviest club , Subdue my worthiest self . The witch shall die : To the young Roman boy she hath sold me , and I fall Under this plot ; she dies for 't . Eros , ho ! Help me , my women ! O ! he is more mad Than Telamon for his shield ; the boar of Thessaly Was never so emboss'd . To the monument ! There lock yourself , and send him word you are dead . The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off . To the monument ! Mardian , go tell him I have slain myself ; Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony ,' And word it , prithee , piteously . Hence , Mardian , and bring me how he takes my death . To the monument ! Eros , thou yet behold'st me ? Ay , noble lord . Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish ; A vapour sometime like a bear or lion , A tower'd citadel , a pendant rock , A forked mountain , or blue promontory With trees upon 't , that nod unto the world And mock our eyes with air : thou hast seen these signs ; They are black vesper's pageants . Ay , my lord . That which is now a horse , even with a thought The rack dislimns , and makes it indistinct , As water is in water . It does , my lord . My good knave , Eros , now thy captain is Even such a body : here I am Antony ; Yet cannot hold this visible shape , my knave . I made these wars for Egypt ; and the queen , Whose heart I thought I had , for she had mine , Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto 't A million more , now lost ; she , Eros , has Pack'd cards with C sar , and false-play'd my glory Unto an enemy's triumph . Nay , weep not , gentle Eros ; there is left us Ourselves to end ourselves . O ! thy vile lady ; She has robb'd me of my sword . No , Antony ; My mistress lov'd thee , and her fortunes mingled With thine entirely . Hence , saucy eunuch ; peace ! She hath betray'd me and shall die the death . Death of one person can be paid but once , And that she has discharg'd . What thou wouldst do Is done unto thy hand ; the last she spake Was , 'Antony ! most noble Antony !' Then in the midst a tearing groan did break The name of Antony ; it was divided Between her heart and lips . She render'd life , Thy name so buried in her . Dead , then ? Dead . Unarm , Eros ; the long day's task is done , And we must sleep . That thou depart'st hence safe , Does pay thy labour richly ; go . Off , pluck off : The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep The battery from my heart . O ! cleave , my sides ; Heart , once be stronger than thy continent , Crack thy frail case ! Apace , Eros , apace . No more a soldier ; bruised pieces , go ; You have been nobly borne . From me awhile . I will o'ertake thee , Cleopatra , and Weep for my pardon . So it must be , for now All length is torture ; since the torch is out , Lie down , and stray no further . Now all labour Mars what it does ; yea , very force entangles Itself with strength ; seal then , and all is done . Eros !I come , my queen .Eros !Stay for me : Where souls do couch on flowers , we'll hand in hand , And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze ; Dido and her neas shall want troops , And all the haunt be ours . Come , Eros ! Eros ! What would my lord ? Since Cleopatra died , I have liv'd in such dishonour , that the gods Detest my baseness . I , that with my sword Quarter'd the world , and o'er green Neptune's back With ships made cities , condemn myself to lack The courage of a woman ; less noble mind Than she , which by her death our C sar tells 'I am conqueror of myself .' Thou art sworn , Eros , That , when the exigent should come ,which now Is come indeed ,when I should see behind me The inevitable prosecution of Disgrace and horror , that , on my command , Thou then wouldst kill me : do 't ; the time is come . Thou strik'st not me , 'tis C sar thou defeat'st . Put colour in thy cheek . The gods withhold me ! Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts , Though enemy , lost aim and could not ? Eros , Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome , and see Thy master thus with pleach'd arms , bending down His corrigible neck , his face subdu'd To penetrative shame , whilst the wheel'd seat Of fortunate C sar , drawn before him , branded His baseness that ensu'd ? I would not see't . Come , then ; for with a wound I must be cur'd . Draw that thy honest sword , which thou hast worn Most useful for thy country . O , sir ! pardon me . When I did make thee free , swor'st thou not then To do this when I bade thee ? Do it at once , Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurpos'd . Draw , and come . Turn from me then that noble countenance , Wherein the worship of the whole world lies . Lo thee ! My sword is drawn . Then let it do at once The thing why thou hast drawn it . My dear master , My captain , and my emperor , let me say , Before I strike this bloody stroke , farewell . 'Tis said , man ; and farewell . Farewell , great chief . Shall I strike now ? Now , Eros . Why , there then ; thus do I escape the sorrow Of Antony's death . Thrice-nobler than myself ! Thou teachest me , O valiant Eros , what I should , and thou couldst not . My queen and Eros Have by their brave instruction got upon me A nobleness in record ; but I will be A bridegroom in my death , and run into 't As to a lover's bed . Come , then ; and , Eros , Thy master dies thy scholar : to do thus I learn'd of thee . How ! not dead ? not dead ? The guard , ho ! O ! dispatch me . What's the noise ? I have done my work ill , friends : O ! make an end Of what I have begun . The star is fallen . And time is at his period . Alas , and woe ! Let him that loves me strike me dead . Not I . Nor I . Nor any one . Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly . This sword but shown to C sar , with this tidings , Shall enter me with him . Where's Antony ? There , Diomed , there . Lives he ? Wilt thou not answer , man ? Art thou there , Diomed ? Draw thy sword , and give me Sufficing strokes for death . Most absolute lord , My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee . When did she send thee ? Now , my lord . Where is she ? Lock'd in her monument . She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass ; for when she saw Which never shall be found you did suspect She had dispos'd with C sar , and that your rage Would not be purg'd , she sent you word she was dead ; But , fearing since how it might work , hath sent Me to proclaim the truth ; and I am come , I dread , too late . Too late , good Diomed . Call my guard , I prithee . What , ho ! the emperor's guard ! The guard , what , ho ! Come , your lord calls ! Bear me , good friends , where Cleopatra bides ; 'Tis the last service that I shall command you . Woe , woe are we , sir , you may not live to wear All your true followers out . Most heavy day ! Nay , good my fellows , do not please sharp fate To grace it with your sorrows ; bid that welcome Which comes to punish us , and we punish it Seeming to bear it lightly . Take me up ; I have led you oft ; carry me now , good friends , And have my thanks for all . O Charmian ! I will never go from hence . Be comforted , dear madam . No , I will not . All strange and terrible events are welcome , But comforts we despise ; our size of sorrow , Proportion'd to our cause , must be as great As that which makes it . How now ! is he dead ? His death's upon him , but not dead . Look out o' the other side your monument ; His guard have brought him thither . O sun ! Burn the great sphere thou mov'st in ; darkling stand The varying star o' the world . O Antony , Antony , Antony ! Help , Charmian , help , Iras , help ; Help , friends below ! let's draw him hither . Peace ! Not C sar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony , But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself . So it should be , that none but Antony Should conquer Antony ; but woe 'tis so ! I am dying , Egypt , dying ; only I here importune death awhile , until Of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips . I dare not , dear , Dear my lord , pardon ,I dare not , Lest I be taken : not the imperious show Of the full-fortun'd C sar ever shall Be brooch'd with me ; if knife , drugs , serpents , have Edge , sting , or operation , I am safe : Your wife Octavia , with her modest eyes And still conclusion , shall acquire no honour Demuring upon me . But come , come , Antony , Help me , my women ,we must draw thee up . Assist , good friends . O ! quick , or I am gone . Here's sport indeed ! How heavy weighs my lord ! Our strength is all gone into heaviness , That makes the weight . Had I great Juno's power , The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up , And set thee by Jove's side . Yet come a little , Wishers were ever fools . O ! come , come , come ; And welcome , welcome ! die where thou hastliv'd ; Quicken with kissing ; had my lips that power , Thus would I wear them out . A heavy sight ! I am dying , Egypt , dying : Give me some wine , and let me speak a little . No , let me speak ; and let me rail so high , That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel , Provok'd by my offence . One word , sweet queen . Of C sar seek your honour with your safety . O ! They do not go together . Gentle , hear me : None about C sar trust , but Proculeius . My resolution and my hands I'll trust ; None about C sar . The miserable change now at my end Lament nor sorrow at ; but please your thoughts In feeding them with those my former fortunes Wherein I liv'd , the greatest prince o' the world , The noblest ; and do now not basely die , Not cowardly put off my helmet to My countryman ; a Roman by a Roman Valiantly vanquish'd . Now my spirit is going ; I can no more . Noblest of men , woo 't die ? Hast thou no care of me ? shall I abide In this dull world , which in thy absence is No better than a sty ? O ! see my women , The crown o' the earth doth melt . My lord ! O ! wither'd is the garland of the war , The soldier's pole is fall'n ; young boys and girls Are level now with men ; the odds is gone , And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon . O , quietness , lady ! She is dead too , our sovereign . Lady ! Madam ! O madam , madam , madam ! Royal Egypt ! Empress ! Peace , peace , Iras ! No more , but e'en a woman , and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares . It were for me To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods ; To tell them that this world did equal theirs Till they had stol'n our jewel . All's but naught ; Patience is sottish , and impatience does Become a dog that's mad ; then is it sin To rush into the secret house of death , Ere death dare come to us ? How do you , women ? What , what ! good cheer ! Why , how now , Charmian ! My noble girls ! Ah , women , women , look ! Our lamp is spent , it's out . Good sirs , take heart ; We'll bury him ; and then , what's brave , what's noble , Let's do it after the high Roman fashion , And make death proud to take us . Come , away ; This case of that huge spirit now is cold ; Ah ! women , women . Come ; we have no friend But resolution , and the briefest end . Go to him , Dolabella , bid him yield ; Being so frustrate , tell him he mocks The pauses that he makes . C sar , I shall . Wherefore is that ? and what art thou that dar'st Appear thus to us ? I am call'd Dercetas ; Mark Antony I serv'd , who best was worthy Best to be serv'd ; whilst he stood up and spoke He was my master , and I wore my life To spend upon his haters . If thou please To take me to thee , as I was to him I'll be to C sar ; if thou pleasest not , I yield thee up my life . What is 't thou sayst ? I say , O C sar , Antony is dead . The breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack ; the round world Should have shook lions into civil streets , And citizens to their dens . The death of Antony Is not a single doom ; in the name lay A moiety of the world . He is dead , C sar ; Not by a public minister of justice , Nor by a hired knife ; but that self hand , Which writ his honour in the acts it did , Hath , with the courage which the heart did lend it , Splitted the heart . This is his sword ; I robb'd his wound of it ; behold it stain'd With his most noble blood . Look you sad , friends ? The gods rebuke me , but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings . And strange it is , That nature must compel us to lament Our most persisted deeds . His taints and honours Wag'd equal with him . A rarer spirit never Did steer humanity ; but you , gods , will give us Some faults to make us men . C sar is touch'd . When such a spacious mirror's set before him , He needs must see himself . O Antony ! I have follow'd thee to this ; but we do lance Diseases in our bodies : I must perforce Have shown to thee such a declining day , Or look on thine ; we could not stall together In the whole world . But yet let me lament , With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts , That thou , my brother , my competitor In top of all design , my mate in empire , Friend and companion in the front of war , The arm of mine own body , and the heart Where mine his thoughts did kindle , that our stars , Unreconciliable , should divide Our equalness to this . Hear me , good friends , But I will tell you at some meeter season : The business of this man looks out of him ; We'll hear him what he says . Whence are you ? A poor Egyptian yet . The queen my mistress , Confin'd in all she has , her monument , Of thy intents desires instruction , That she preparedly may frame herself To the way she's forc'd to . Bid her have good heart ; She soon shall know of us , by some of ours , How honourable and how kindly we Determine for her ; for C sar cannot live To be ungentle . So the gods preserve thee ! Come hither , Proculeius . Go and say , We purpose her no shame ; give her what comforts The quality of her passion shall require , Lest , in her greatness , by some mortal stroke She do defeat us ; for her life in Rome Would be eternal in our triumph . Go , And with your speediest bring us what she says , And how you find of her . C sar , I shall . Gallus , go you along . To second Proculeius ? Dolabella ! Dolabella ! Let him alone , for I remember now How he's employ'd , he shall in time be ready . Go with me to my tent ; where you shall see How hardly I was drawn into this war ; How calm and gentle I proceeded still In all my writings . Go with me , and see What I can show in this . My desolation does begin to make A better life . 'Tis paltry to be C sar ; Not being Fortune , he's but Fortune's knave , A minister of her will ; and it is great To do that thing that ends all other deeds , Which shackles accidents , and bolts up change , Which sleeps , and never palates more the dug , The beggar's nurse and C sar's . C sar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt ; And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean'st to have him grant thee . What's thy name ? My name is Proculeius . Antony Did tell me of you , bade me trust you ; but I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd , That have no use for trusting . If your master Would have a queen his beggar , you must tell him , That majesty , to keep decorum , must No less beg than a kingdom ; if he please To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son , He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks . Be of good cheer ; You're fall'n into a princely hand , fear nothing . Make your full reference freely to my lord , Who is so full of grace , that it flows over On all that need ; let me report to him Your sweet dependancy , and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness Where he for grace is kneel'd to . Pray you , tell him I am his fortune's vassal , and I send him The greatness he has got . I hourly learn A doctrine of obedience , and would gladly Look him i' the face . This I'll report , dear lady : Have comfort , for I know your plight is pitied Of him that caus'd it . You see how easily she may be surpris'd . Guard her till C sar come . Royal queen ! O Cleopatra ! thou art taken , queen . Quick , quick , good hands . Hold , worthy lady , hold ! Do not yourself such wrong , who are in this Reliev'd , but not betray'd . What , of death too , That rids our dogs of languish ? Cleopatra , Do not abuse my master's bounty by The undoing of yourself ; let the world see His nobleness well acted , which your death Will never let come forth . Where art thou , death ? Come hither , come ! come , come , and take a queen Worth many babes and beggars ! O ! temperance , lady . Sir , I will eat no meat , I'll not drink , sir ; If idle talk will once be necessary , I'll not sleep neither . This mortal house I'll ruin , Do C sar what he can . Know , sir , that I Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court , Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye Of dull Octavia . Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome ? Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me ! rather on Nilus' mud Lay me stark nak'd , and let the water-flies Blow me into abhorring ! rather make My country's high pyramides my gibbet , And hang me up in chains ! You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in C sar . Proculeius , What thou hast done thy master C sar knows , And he hath sent for thee ; as for the queen , I'll take her to my guard . So , Dolabella , It shall content me best ; be gentle to her . To C sar I will speak what you shall please , If you'll employ me to him . Say , I would die . Most noble empress , you have heard of me ? I cannot tell . Assuredly you know me . No matter , sir , what I have heard or known . You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams ; Is 't not your trick ? I understand not , madam . I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony : O ! such another sleep , that I might see But such another man . If it might please ye , His face was as the heavens , and therein stuck A sun and moon , which kept their course , and lighted The little O , the earth . Most sovereign creature , His legs besfrid the ocean ; his rear'd arm Crested the world ; his voice was propertied As all the tuned spheres , and that to friends ; But when he meant to quail and shake the orb , He was as rattling thunder . For his bounty , There was no winter in 't , an autumn 'twas That grew the more by reaping ; his delights Were dolphin-like , they show'd his back above The element they liv'd in ; in his livery Walk'd crowns and crownets , realms and islands were As plates dropp'd from his pocket . Cleopatra , Think you there was , or might be , such a man As this I dream'd of ? Gentle madam , no . You lie , up to the hearing of the gods . But , if there be , or ever were , one such , It's past the size of dreaming ; nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy ; yet to imagine An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy , Condemning shadows quite . Hear me , good madam . Your loss is as yourself , great ; and you bear it As answering to the weight : would I might never O'ertake pursu'd success , but I do feel , By the rebound of yours , a grief that smites My very heart at root . I thank you , sir . Know you what C sar means to do with me ? I am loath to tell you what I would you knew . Nay , pray you , sir , Though he be honourable , He'll lead me then in triumph ? Madam , he will ; I know 't . Which is the Queen of Egypt ? It is the emperor , madam . Arise , you shall not kneel . I pray you , rise ; rise , Egypt . Sir , the gods Will have it thus ; my master and my lord I must obey . Take to you no hard thoughts ; The record of what injuries you did us , Though written in our flesh , we shall remember As things but done by chance . Sole sir o' the world , I cannot project mine own cause so well To make it clear ; but do confess I have Been laden with like frailties which before Have often sham'd our sex . Cleopatra , know , We will extenuate rather than enforce : If you apply yourself to our intents , Which towards you are most gentle ,you shall find A benefit in this change ; but if you seek To lay on me a cruelty , by taking Antony's course , you shall bereave yourself Of my good purposes , and put your children To that destruction which I'll guard them from , If thereon you rely . I'll take my leave . And may through all the world : 'tis yours ; and we , Your scutcheons , and your signs of conquest , shall Hang in what place you please . Here , my good lord . You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra . This is the brief of money , plate , and jewels , I am possess'd of : 'tis exactly valued ; Not petty things admitted . Where's Seleucus ? Here , madam . This is my treasurer ; let him speak , my lord , Upon his peril , that I have reserv'd To myself nothing . Speak the truth , Seleucus . Madam , I had rather seal my lips , than , to my peril , Speak that which is not . What have I kept back ? Enough to purchase what you have made known . Nay , blush not , Cleopatra ; I approve Your wisdom in the deed . See ! C sar ! O , behold , How pomp is follow'd ; mine will now be yours ; And , should we shift estates , yours would be mine . The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild . O slave ! of no more trust Than love that's hir'd . What ! goest thou back ? thou shalt Go back , I warrant thee ; but I'll catch thine eyes , Though they had wings : slave , soulless villain , dog ! O rarely base ! Good queen , let us entreat you . O C sar ! what a wounding shame is this , That thou , vouchsafing here to visit me , Doing the honour of thy lordliness To one so meek , that mine own servant should Parcel the sum of my disgraces by Addition of his envy . Say , good C sar , That I some lady trifles have reserv'd , Immoment toys , things of such dignity As we greet modern friends withal ; and say , Some nobler token I have kept apart For Livia and Octavia , to induce Their mediation ; must I be unfolded With one that I have bred ? The gods ! it smites me Beneath the fall I have . Prithee , go hence ; Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits Through the ashes of my chance . Wert thou a man , Thou wouldst have mercy on me . Forbear , Seleucus . Be it known that we , the greatest , are misthought For things that others do ; and , when we fall , We answer others' merits in our name , Are therefore to be pitied . Cleopatra , Not what you have reserv'd , nor what acknowledg'd , Put we i' the roll of conquest : still be 't yours , Bestow it at your pleasure ; and believe , C sar's no merchant , to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold . Therefore be cheer'd ; Make not your thoughts your prisons : no , dear queen ; For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel . Feed , and sleep : Our care and pity is so much upon you , That we remain your friend ; and so , adieu . My master , and my lord ! Not so . Adieu . He words me , girls , he words me , that I should not Be noble to myself : but , hark thee , Charmian . Finish , good lady ; the bright day is done , And we are for the dark . Hie thee again : I have spoke already , and it is provided ; Go , put it to the haste . Madam , I will . Where is the queen ? Behold , sir . Dolabella ! Madam , as thereto sworn by your command , Which my love makes religion to obey , I tell you this : C sar through Syria Intends his journey ; and within three days You with your children will be send before . Make your best use of this ; I have perform'd Your pleasure and my promise . Dolabella , I shall remain your debtor . I your servant . Adieu , good queen ; I must attend on C sar . Farewell , and thanks . Now , Iras , what think'st thou ? Thou , an Egyptian puppet , shall be shown In Rome , as well as I ; mechanic slaves With greasy aprons , rules and hammers , shall Uplift us to the view ; in their thick breaths , Rank of gross diet , shall we be enclouded , And forc'd to drink their vapour . The gods forbid ! Nay , 'tis most certain , Iras . Saucy lictors Will catch at us , like strumpets , and scald rimers Ballad us out o' tune ; the quick comedians Extemporally will stage us , and present Our Alexandrian revels . Antony Shall be brought drunken forth , and I shall see Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness I' the posture of a whore . O , the good gods ! Nay , that's certain . I'll never see it ; for , I am sure my nails Are stronger than mine eyes . Why , that's the way To fool their preparation , and to conquer Their most absurd intents . Now , Charmian , Show me , my women , like a queen ; go fetch My best attires ; I am again for Cydnus , To meet Mark Antony . Sirrah Iras , go . Now , noble Charmian , we'll dispatch indeed ; And , when thou hast done this chare , I'll give thee leave To play till doomsday . Bring our crown and all . Wherefore's this noise ? Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your highness' presence : He brings you figs . Let him come in . What poor an instrument May do a noble deed ! he brings me liberty . My resolution's plac'd , and I have nothing Of woman in me ; now from head to foot I am marble-constant , now the fleeting moon No planet is of mine . This is the man . Avoid , and leave him . Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there , That kills and pains not ? Truly , I have him ; but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him , for his biting is immortal ; those that do die of it do seldom or never recover . Remember'st thou any that have died on 't ? Very many , men and women too . I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday ; a very honest woman , but something given to lie , as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty , how she died of the biting of it , what pain she felt . Truly , she makes a very good report o' the worm ; but he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do . But this is most fallible , the worm's an odd worm . Get thee hence ; farewell . I wish you all joy of the worm . Farewell . You must think this , look you , that the worm will do his kind . Ay , ay ; farewell . Look you , the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people ; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm . Take thou no care ; it shall be heeded . Very good . Give it nothing , I pray you , for it is not worth the feeding . Will it eat me ? You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman ; I know that a woman is a dish for the gods , if the devil dress her not . But , truly , these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women , for in every ten that they make , the devils mar five . Well , get thee gone ; farewell . Yes , forsooth ; I wish you joy of the worm . Give me my robe , put on my crown ; I have Immortal longings in me ; now no more The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip . Yare , yare , good Iras ; quick . Methinks I hear Antony call ; I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act ; I hear him mock The luck of C sar , which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath : husband , I come : Now to that name my courage prove my title ! I am fire , and air ; my other elements I give to baser life . So ; have you done ? Come then , and take the last warmth of my lips . Farewell , kind Charmian ; Iras , long farewell . Have I the aspic in my lips ? Dost fall ? If thou and nature can so gently part , The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch , Which hurts , and is desir'd . Dost thou lie still ? If thus thou vanishest , thou tell'st the world It is not worth leave-taking . Dissolve , thick cloud , and rain ; that I may say , The gods themselves do weep . This proves me base : If she first meet the curled Antony , He'll make demand of her , and spend that kiss Which is my heaven to have . Come , thou mortal wretch , With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie ; poor venomous fool , Be angry , and dispatch . O ! couldst thou speak , That I might hear thee call great C sar ass Unpolicied . O eastern star ! Peace , peace ! Dost thou not see my baby at my breast , That sucks the nurse asleep ? O , break ! O , break ! As sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle , O Antony !Nay , I will take thee too . What should I stay In this vile world ? So , fare thee well . Now boast thee , death , in thy possession lies A lass unparallel'd . Downy windows , close ; And golden Ph bus never be beheld Of eyes again so royal ! Your crown's awry ; I'll mend it , and then play . Where is the queen ? Speak softly , wake her not . C sar hath sent Too slow a messenger . O ! come apace , dispatch ; I partly feel thee . Approach , ho ! All's not well ; C sar's beguil'd . There's Dolabella sent from C sar ; call him . What work is here ! Charmian , is this well done ? It is well done , and fitting for a princess Descended of so many royal kings . Ah ! soldier . How goes it here ? All dead . C sar , thy thoughts Touch their effects in this ; thyself art coming To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou So sought'st to hinder . O ! sir , you are too sure an augurer ; That you did fear is done . Bravest at the last , She levell'd at our purposes , and , being royal , Took her own way . The manner of their deaths ? I do not see them bleed . Who was last with them ? A simple countryman that brought her figs : This was his basket . Poison'd then . O C sar ! This Charmian liv'd but now ; she stood , and spake : I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress ; tremblingly she stood , And on the sudden dropp'd . O noble weakness ! If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear By external swelling ; but she looks like sleep , As she would catch another Antony In her strong toil of grace . Here , on her breast , There is a vent of blood , and something blown ; The like is on her arm . This is an aspic's trail ; and these fig-leaves Have slime upon them , such as the aspic leaves Upon the caves of Nile . Most probable That so she died ; for her physician tells me She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite Of easy ways to die . Take up her bed ; And bear her women from the monument . She shall be buried by her Antony : No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous . High events as these Strike those that make them ; and their story is No less in pity than his glory which Brought them to be lamented . Our army shall , In solemn show , attend this funeral , And then to Rome . Come , Dolabella , see High order in this great solemnity .
