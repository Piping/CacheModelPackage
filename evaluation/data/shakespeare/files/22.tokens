'Tis burnt ; and so is all the meat . What dogs are these ! Where is the rascal cook ? How durst you , villains , bring it from the dresser , And serve it thus to me that love it not ? There , take it to you , trenchers , cups , and all . You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves ! What ! do you grumble ? I'll be with you straight . I pray you , husband , be not so disquiet : The meat was well if you were so contented . I tell thee , Kate , 'twas burnt and dried away ; And I expressly am forbid to touch it , For it engenders choler , planteth anger ; And better 'twere that both of us did fast , Since , of ourselves , ourselves are choleric , Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh . Be patient ; to-morrow't shall be mended , And for this night we'll fast for company : Come , I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber . Peter , didst ever see the like ? He kills her in her own humour . Where is he ? In her chamber , making a sermon of continency to her ; And rails , and swears , and rates , that she , poor soul , Knows not which way to stand , to look , to speak , And sits as one new-risen from a dream . Away , away ! for he is coming hither . Thus have I politicly begun my reign , And 'tis my hope to end successfully . My falcon now is sharp and passing empty , And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg'd , For then she never looks upon her lure . Another way I have to man my haggard , To make her come and know her keeper's call ; That is , to watch her , as we watch these kites That bate and beat and will not be obedient . She eat no meat to-day , nor none shall eat ; Last night she slept not , nor to-night she shall not : As with the meat , some undeserved fault I'll find about the making of the bed ; And here I'll fling the pillow , there the bolster , This way the coverlet , another way the sheets : Ay , and amid this hurly I intend That all is done in reverend care of her ; And in conclusion she shall watch all night : And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl , And with the clamour keep her still awake . This is a way to kill a wife with kindness ; And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour . He that knows better how to tame a shrew , Now let him speak : 'tis charity to show . Is't possible , friend Licio , that Mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio ? I tell you , sir , she bears me fair in hand . Sir , to satisfy you in what I have said , Stand by , and mark the manner of his teaching . Now , mistress , profit you in what you read ? What , master , read you ? first resolve me that . I read that I profess , the Art to Love . And may you prove , sir , master of your art ! While you , sweet dear , prove mistress of my heart . Quick proceeders , marry ! Now , tell me , I pray , You that durst swear that your mistress Bianca Lov'd none in the world so well as Lucentio . O despiteful love ! unconstant womankind ! I tell thee , Licio , this is wonderful . Mistake no more : I am not Licio , Nor a musician , as I seem to be ; But one that scorns to live in this disguise , For such a one as leaves a gentleman , And makes a god of such a cullion : Know , sir , that I am call'd Hortensio . Signior Hortensio , I have often heard Of your entire affection to Bianca ; And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness , I will with you , if you be so contented , Forswear Bianca and her love for ever . See , how they kiss and court ! Signior Lucentio , Here is my hand , and here I firmly vow Never to woo her more ; but I do forswear her , As one unworthy all the former favours That I have fondly flatter'd her withal . And here I take the like unfeigned oath , Never to marry with her though she would entreat . Fie on her ! see how beastly she doth court him . Would all the world , but he had quite forsworn ! For me , that I may surely keep mine oath , I will be married to a wealthy widow Ere three days pass , which hath as long lov'd me As I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard . And so farewell , Signior Lucentio . Kindness in women , not their beauteous looks , Shall win my love : and so I take my leave , In resolution as I swore before . Mistress Bianca , bless you with such grace As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case ! Nay , I have ta'en you napping , gentle love , And have forsworn you with Hortensio . Tranio , you jest . But have you both forsworn me ? Mistress , we have . Then we are rid of Licio . I' faith , he'll have a lusty widow now , That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day . God give him joy ! Ay , and he'll tame her . He says so , Tranio . Faith , he is gone unto the taming-school . The taming-school ! what , is there such a place ? Ay , mistress , and Petruchio is the master ; That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long , To tame a shrew , and charm her chattering tongue . O master , master ! I have watch'd so long That I'm dog-weary ; but at last I spied An ancient angel coming down the hill Will serve the turn . What is he , Biondello ? Master , a mercatante , or a pedant , I know not what ; but formal in apparel , In gait and countenance surely like a father . And what of him , Tranio ? If he be credulous and trust my tale , I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio , And give assurance to Baptista Minola , As if he were the right Vincentio . Take in your love , and then let me alone . God save you , sir ! And you , sir ! you are welcome . Travel you far on , or are you at the furthest ? Sir , at the furthest for a week or two ; But then up further , and as far as Rome ; And so to Tripoli , if God lend me life . What countryman , I pray ? Of Mantua . Of Mantua , sir ! marry , God forbid ! And come to Padua , careless of your life ? My life , sir ! how , I pray ? for that goes hard . 'Tis death for any one in Mantua To come to Padua . Know you not the cause ? Your ships are stay'd at Venice ; and the duke , For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him , Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly . 'Tis marvel , but that you are but newly come , You might have heard it else proclaim'd about . Alas , sir ! it is worse for me than so ; For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence , and must here deliver them . Well , sir , to do you courtesy , This will I do , and this I will advise you : First , tell me , have you ever been at Pisa ? Ay , sir , in Pisa have I often been ; Pisa , renowned for grave citizens . Among them , know you one Vincentio ? I know him not , but I have heard of him ; A merchant of incomparable wealth . He is my father , sir ; and , sooth to say , In countenance somewhat doth resemble you . As much as an apple doth an oyster , and all one . To save your life in this extremity , This favour will I do you for his sake ; And think it not the worst of all your fortunes That you are like to Sir Vincentio . His name and credit shall you undertake , And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd , Look that you take upon you as you should ! You understand me , sir ; so shall you stay Till you have done your business in the city . If this be courtesy , sir , accept of it . O sir , I do ; and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty . Then go with me to make the matter good . This , by the way , I let you understand : My father is here look'd for every day , To pass assurance of a dower in marriage 'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here : In all these circumstances I'll instruct you . Go with me to clothe you as becomes you . No , no , forsooth ; I dare not , for my life . The more my wrong the more his spite appears . What , did he marry me to famish me ? Beggars , that come unto my father's door , Upon entreaty have a present alms ; If not , elsewhere they meet with charity : But I , who never knew how to entreat , Nor never needed that I should entreat , Am starv'd for meat , giddy for lack of sleep ; With oaths kept waking , and with brawling fed . And that which spites me more than all these wants , He does it under name of perfect love ; As who should say , if I should sleep or eat 'Twere deadly sickness , or else present death . I prithee go and get me some repast ; I care not what , so it be wholesome food . What say you to a neat's foot ? 'Tis passing good : I prithee let me have it . I fear it is too choleric a meat . How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd ? I like it well : good Grumio , fetch it me . I cannot tell ; I fear 'tis choleric . What say you to a piece of beef and mustard ? A dish that I do love to feed upon . Ay , but the mustard is too hot a little . Why , then the beef , and let the mustard rest . Nay , then I will not : you shall have the mustard , Or else you get no beef of Grumio . Then both , or one , or anything thou wilt . Why then , the mustard without the beef . Go , get thee gone , thou false deluding slave , That feed'st me with the very name of meat . Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you , That triumph thus upon my misery ! Go , get thee gone , I say . How fares my Kate ? What , sweeting , all amort ? Mistress , what cheer ? Faith , as cold as can be . Pluck up thy spirits ; look cheerfully upon me . Here , love ; thou seest how diligent I am , To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee : I am sure , sweet Kate , this kindness merits thanks . What ! not a word ? Nay then , thou lov'st it not , And all my pains is sorted to no proof . Here , take away this dish . I pray you , let it stand . The poorest service is repaid with thanks , And so shall mine , before you touch the meat . I thank you , sir . Signior Petruchio , fie ! you are to blame . Come , Mistress Kate , I'll bear you company . Eat it up all , Hortensio , if thou lov'st me . Much good do it unto thy gentle heart ! Kate , eat apace : and now , my honey love , Will we return unto thy father's house , And revel it as bravely as the best , With silken coats and caps and golden rings , With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things ; With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery , With amber bracelets , beads and all this knavery . What ! hast thou din'd ? The tailor stays thy leisure , To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure . Come , tailor , let us see these ornaments ; Lay forth the gown . What news with you , sir ? Here is the cap your worship did bespeak . Why , this was moulded on a porringer ; A velvet dish : fie , fie ! 'tis lewd and filthy : Why , 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell , A knack , a toy , a trick , a baby's cap : Away with it ! come , let me have a bigger . I'll have no bigger : this doth fit the time , And gentlewomen wear such caps as these . When you are gentle , you shall have one too ; And not till then . That will not be in haste . Why , sir , I trust I may have leave to speak , And speak I will ; I am no child , no babe : Your betters have endur'd me say my mind , And if you cannot , best you stop your ears . My tongue will tell the anger of my heart , Or else my heart , concealing it , will break : And rather than it shall , I will be free Even to the uttermost , as I please , in words . Why , thou sayst true ; it is a paltry cap , A custard-coffin , a bauble , a silken pie . I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not . Love me or love me not , I like the cap , And it I will have , or I will have none . Thy gown ? why , ay : come , tailor , let us see't . O mercy , God ! what masquing stuff is here ? What's this ? a sleeve ? 'tis like a demi-cannon : What ! up and down , carv'd like an apple-tart ? Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash , Like to a censer in a barber's shop . Why , what , i' devil's name , tailor , call'st thou this ? I see , she's like to have neither cap nor gown . You bid me make it orderly and well , According to the fashion and the time . Marry , and did : but if you be remember'd , I did not bid you mar it to the time . Go , hop me over every kennel home , For you shall hop without my custom , sir . I'll none of it : hence ! make your best of it . I never saw a better-fashion'd gown , More quaint , more pleasing , nor more commendable . Belike you mean to make a puppet of me . Why , true ; he means to make a puppet of thee . She says your worship means to make a puppet of her . O monstrous arrogance ! Thou liest , thou thread , Thou thimble , Thou yard , three-quarters , half-yard , quarter , nail ! Thou flea , thou nit , thou winter-cricket thou ! Brav'd in mine own house with a skein of thread ! Away ! thou rag , thou quantity , thou remnant , Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st ! I tell thee , I , that thou hast marr'd her gown . Your worship is deceiv'd : the gown is made Just as my master had direction . Grumio gave order how it should be done . I gave him no order ; I gave him the stuff . But how did you desire it should be made ? Marry , sir , with needle and thread . But did you not request to have it cut ? Thou hast faced many things . I have . Face not me : thou hast braved many men ; brave not me : I will neither be faced nor braved . I say unto thee , I bid thy master cut out the gown ; but I did not bid him cut it to pieces : ergo , thou liest . Why , here is the note of the fashion to testify . Read it . The note lies in's throat if he say I said so . Imprimis . A loose-bodied gown . Master , if ever I said loose-bodied gown , sew me in the skirts of it , and beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread . I said , a gown . Proceed . With a small compassed cape . I confess the cape . With a trunk sleeve . I confess two sleeves . The sleeves curiously cut . Ay , there's the villany . Error i' the bill , sir ; error i' the bill . I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again ; and that I'll prove upon thee , though thy little finger be armed in a thimble . This is true that I say : an I had thee in place where thou shouldst know it . I am for thee straight : take thou the bill , give me thy mete-yard , and spare not me . God-a-mercy , Grumio ! then he shall have no odds . Well , sir , in brief , the gown is not for me . You are i' the right , sir ; 'tis for my mistress . Go , take it up unto thy master's use . Villain , not for thy life ! take up my mistress' gown for thy master's use ! Why , sir , what's your conceit in that ? O , sir , the conceit is deeper than you think for . Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use ! O , fie , fie , fie ! Hortensio , say thou wilt see the tailor paid . Go take it hence ; be gone , and say no more . Tailor , I'll pay thee for thy gown to-morrow : Take no unkindness of his hasty words . Away ! I say ; commend me to thy master . Well , come , my Kate ; we will unto your father's , Even in these honest mean habiliments . Our purses shall be proud , our garments poor : For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich ; And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds , So honour peereth in the meanest habit . What is the jay more precious than the lark Because his feathers are more beautiful ? Or is the adder better than the eel Because his painted skin contents the eye ? O , no , good Kate ; neither art thou the worse For this poor furniture and mean array . If thou account'st it shame , lay it on me ; And therefore frolic : we will hence forthwith , To feast and sport us at thy father's house . Go , call my men , and let us straight to him ; And bring our horses unto Long-lane end ; There will we mount , and thither walk on foot . Let's see ; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock , And well we may come there by dinner-time . I dare assure you , sir , 'tis almost two ; And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there . It shall be seven ere I go to horse . Look , what I speak , or do , or think to do , You are still crossing it . Sirs , let't alone : I will not go to-day ; and ere I do , It shall be what o'clock I say it is . Why , so this gallant will command the sun . Sir , this is the house : please it you that I call ? Ay , what else ? and , but I be deceived , Signior Baptista may remember me , Near twenty years ago , in Genoa , Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus . 'Tis well ; and hold your own , in any case , With such austerity as 'longeth to a father . I warrant you . But , sir , here comes your boy ; 'Twere good he were school'd . Fear you not him . Sirrah Biondello , Now do your duty throughly , I advise you : Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio . Tut ! fear not me . But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista ? I told him that your father was at Venice , And that you look'd for him this day in Padua . Thou'rt a tall fellow : hold thee that to drink . Here comes Baptista . Set your countenance , sir . Signior Baptista , you are happily met . Sir , this is the gentleman I told you of : I pray you , stand good father to me now , Give me Bianca for my patrimony . Soft , son ! Sir , by your leave : having come to Padua To gather in some debts , my son Lucentio Made me acquainted with a weighty cause Of love between your daughter and himself : And ,for the good report I hear of you , And for the love he beareth to your daughter , And she to him ,to stay him not too long , I am content , in a good father's care , To have him match'd ; and , if you please to like No worse than I , upon some agreement Me shall you find ready and willing With one consent to have her so bestow'd ; For curious I cannot be with you , Signior Baptista , of whom I hear so well . Sir , pardon me in what I have to say : Your plainness and your shortness please me well . Right true it is , your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him , Or both dissemble deeply their affections : And therefore , if you say no more than this , That like a father you will deal with him And pass my daughter a sufficient dower , The match is made , and all is done : Your son shall have my daughter with consent . I thank you , sir . Where , then , do you know best We be affied and such assurance ta'en As shall with either part's agreement stand ? Not in my house , Lucentio ; for , you know , Pitchers have ears , and I have many servants . Besides , old Gremio is hearkening still , And happily we might be interrupted . Then at my lodging an it like you : There doth my father lie , and there this night We'll pass the business privately and well . Send for your daughter by your servant here ; My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently . The worst is this , that , at so slender warning , You're like to have a thin and slender pittance . It likes me well . Cambio , hie you home , And bid Bianca make her ready straight ; And , if you will , tell what hath happened : Lucentio's father is arriv'd in Padua , And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife . I pray the gods she may with all my heart ! Dally not with the gods , but get thee gone . Signior Baptista , shall I lead the way ? Welcome ! one mess is like to be your cheer . Come , sir ; we will better it in Pisa . I follow you . Cambio ! What sayst thou , Biondello ? You saw my master wink and laugh upon you ? Biondello , what of that ? Faith , nothing ; but he has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens . I pray thee , moralize them . Then thus . Baptista is safe , talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son . And what of him ? His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper . And then ? The old priest at Saint Luke's church is at your command at all hours . And what of all this ? I cannot tell , expect they are busied about a counterfeit assurance : take you assurance of her , cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum . To the church ! take the priest , clerk , and some sufficient honest witnesses . If this be not that you look for , I have no more to say , But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day . Hearest thou , Biondello ? I cannot tarry : I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit ; and so may you , sir ; and so , adieu , sir . My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke's , to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix . I may , and will , if she be so contented : She will be pleas'd ; then wherefore should I doubt ? Hap what hap may , I'll roundly go about her : It shall go hard if Cambio go without her . Come on , i' God's name ; once more toward our father's . Good Lord , how bright and goodly shines the moon ! The moon ! the sun : it is not moonlight now . I say it is the moon that shines so bright . I know it is the sun that shines so bright . Now , by my mother's son , and that's myself , It shall be moon , or star , or what I list , Or ere I journey to your father's house . Go one and fetch our horses back again . Evermore cross'd and cross'd ; nothing but cross'd ! Say as he says , or we shall never go . Forward , I pray , since we have come so far , And be it moon , or sun , or what you please . An if you please to call it a rush-candle , Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me . I say it is the moon . I know it is the moon . Nay , then you lie ; it is the blessed sun . Then God be bless'd , it is the blessed sun : But sun it is not when you say it is not , And the moon changes even as your mind . What you will have it nam'd , even that it is ; And so , it shall be so for Katharine . Petruchio , go thy ways ; the field is won . Well , forward , forward ! thus the bowl should run , And not unluckily against the bias . But soft ! what company is coming here ? Good morrow , gentle mistress : where away ? Tell me , sweet Kate , and tell me truly too , Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman ? Such war of white and red within her cheeks ! What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty , As those two eyes become that heavenly face ? Fair lovely maid , once more good day to thee . Sweet Kate , embrace her for her beauty's sake . A' will make the man mad , to make a woman of him . Young budding virgin , fair and fresh and sweet , Whither away , or where is thy abode ? Happy the parents of so fair a child ; Happier the man , whom favourable stars Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow ! Why , how now , Kate ! I hope thou art not mad : This is a man , old , wrinkled , faded , wither'd , And not a maiden , as thou sayst he is . Pardon , old father , my mistaking eyes , That have been so bedazzled with the sun That everything I look on seemeth green : Now I perceive thou art a reverend father ; Pardon , I pray thee , for my mad mistaking . Do , good old grandsire ; and withal make known Which way thou travellest : if along with us , We shall be joyful of thy company . Fair sir , and you my merry mistress , That with your strange encounter much amaz'd me , My name is called Vincentio ; my dwelling , Pisa ; And bound I am to Padua , there to visit A son of mine , which long I have not seen . What is his name ? Lucentio , gentle sir . Happily met ; the happier for thy son . And now by law , as well as reverend age , I may entitle thee my loving father : The sister to my wife , this gentlewoman , Thy son by this hath married . Wonder not , Nor be not griev'd : she is of good esteem , Her dowry wealthy , and of worthy birth ; Beside , so qualified as may beseem The spouse of any noble gentleman . Let me embrace with old Vincentio ; And wander we to see thy honest son , Who will of thy arrival be full joyous . But is this true ? or is it else your pleasure , Like pleasant travellers , to break a jest Upon the company you overtake ? I do assure thee , father , so it is . Come , go along , and see the truth hereof ; For our first merriment hath made thee jealous . Well , Petruchio , this has put me in heart . Have to my widow ! and if she be froward , Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward . Softly and swiftly , sir , for the priest is ready . I fly , Biondello : but they may chance to need thee at home ; therefore leave us . Nay , faith , I'll see the church o' your back ; and then come back to my master as soon as I can . I marvel Cambio comes not all this while . Sir , here's the door , this is Lucentio's house : My father's bears more toward the marketplace ; Thither must I , and here I leave you , sir . You shall not choose but drink before you go . I think I shall command your welcome here , And , by all likelihood , some cheer is toward . They're busy within ; you were best knock louder . What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate ? Is Signior Lucentio within , sir ? He's within , sir , but not to be spoken withal . What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two , to make merry withal ? Keep your hundred pounds to yourself : he shall need none so long as I live . Nay , I told you your son was well beloved in Padua . Do you hear , sir ? To leave frivolous circumstances , I pray you , tell Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa , and is here at the door to speak with him . Thou liest : his father is come from Padua , and here looking out at the window . Art thou his father ? Ay , sir ; so his mother says , if I may believe her . Why , how now , gentleman ! why , this is flat knavery , to take upon you another man's name . Lay hands on the villain : I believe , a' means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance . I have seen them in the church together : God send 'em good shipping ! But who is here ? mine old master , Vincentio ! now we are undone and brought to nothing . Come hither , crack-hemp . I hope I may choose , sir . Come hither , you rogue . What , have you forgot me ? Forgot you ! no , sir : I could not forget you , for I never saw you before in all my life . What , you notorious villain ! didst thou never see thy master's father , Vincentio ? What , my old , worshipful old master ? yes , marry , sir : see where he looks out of the window . Is't so , indeed ? Help , help , help ! here's a madman will murder me . Help , son ! help , Signior Baptista ! Prithee , Kate , let's stand aside , and see the end of this controversy . Sir , what are you that offer to beat my servant ? What am I , sir ! nay , what are you , sir ? O immortal gods ! O fine villain ! A silken doublet ! a velvet hose ! a scarlet cloak ! and a copatain hat ! O , I am undone ! I am undone ! while I play the good husband at home , my son and my servant spend all at the university . How now ! what's the matter ? What , is the man lunatic ? Sir , you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit , but your words show you a madman . Why , sir , what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold ? I thank my good father , I am able to maintain it . Thy father ! O villain ! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo . You mistake , sir , you mistake , sir . Pray , what do you think is his name ? His name ! as if I knew not his name : I have brought him up ever since he was three years old , and his name is Tranio . Away , away , mad ass ! his name is Lucentio ; and he is mine only son , and heir to the lands of me , Signior Vincentio . Lucentio ! O ! he hath murdered his master . Lay hold on him , I charge you in the duke's name . O my son , my son ! tell me , thou villain , where is my son Lucentio ? Call forth an officer . Carry this mad knave to the gaol . Father Baptista , I charge you see that he be forthcoming . Carry me to the gaol ! Stay , officer : he shall not go to prison . Talk not , Signior Gremio : I say he shall go to prison . Take heed , Signior Baptista , lest you be cony-catched in this business : I dare swear this is the right Vincentio . Swear , if thou darest . Nay , I dare not swear it . Then thou wert best say , that I am not Lucentio . Yes , I know thee to be Signior Lucentio . Away with the dotard ! to the gaol with him ! Thus strangers may be haled and abused : O monstrous villain ! O ! we are spoiled ; and yonder he is : deny him , forswear him , or else we are all undone . Pardon , sweet father . Lives my sweetest son ? Pardon , dear father . How hast thou offended ? Where is Lucentio ? Here's Lucentio , Right son to the right Vincentio ; That have by marriage made thy daughter mine , While counterfeit supposes blear'd thine eyne . Here's packing , with a witness , to deceive us all ! Where is that damned villain Tranio , That fac'd and brav'd me in this matter so ? Why , tell me , is not this my Cambio ? Cambio is chang'd into Lucentio . Love wrought these miracles . Bianca's love Made me exchange my state with Tranio , While he did bear my countenance in the town ; And happily I have arriv'd at last Unto the wished haven of my bliss . What Tranio did , myself enforc'd him to ; Then pardon him , sweet father , for my sake . I'll slit the villain's nose , that would have sent me to the gaol . But do you hear , sir ? Have you married my daughter without asking my good will ? Fear not , Baptista ; we will content you , go to : but I will in , to be revenged for this villany . And I , to sound the depth of this knavery . Look not pale , Bianca ; thy father will not frown . My cake is dough ; but I'll in among the rest , Out of hope of all , but my share of the feast . Husband , let's follow , to see the end of this ado . First kiss me , Kate , and we will . What ! in the midst of the street ? What ! art thou ashamed of me ? No , sir , God forbid ; but ashamed to kiss . Why , then let's home again . Come , sirrah , let's away . Nay , I will give thee a kiss : now pray thee , love , stay . Is not this well ? Come , my sweet Kate : Better once than never , for never too late . At last , though long , our jarring notes agree : And time it is , when raging war is done , To smile at 'scapes and perils overblown . My fair Bianca , bid my father welcome , While I with self-same kindness welcome thine . Brother Petruchio , sister Katharina , And thou , Hortensio , with thy loving widow , Feast with the best , and welcome to my house : My banquet is to close our stomachs up , After our great good cheer . Pray you , sit down ; For now we sit to chat as well as eat . Nothing but sit and sit , and eat and eat ! Padua affords this kindness , son Petruchio . Padua affords nothing but what is kind . For both our sakes I would that word were true . Now , for my life , Hortensio fears his widow . Then never trust me , if I be afeard . You are very sensible , and yet you miss my sense : I mean , Hortensio is afeard of you . He that is giddy thinks the world turns round . Roundly replied . Mistress , how mean you that ? Thus I conceive by him . Conceives by me ! How likes Hortensio that ? My widow says , thus she conceives her tale . Very well mended . Kiss him for that , good widow . 'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round :' I pray you , tell me what you meant by that . Your husband , being troubled with a shrew , Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe : And now you know my meaning . A very mean meaning . Right , I mean you . And I am mean , indeed , respecting you . To her , Kate ! To her , widow ! A hundred marks , my Kate does put her down . That's my office . Spoke like an officer : ha' to thee , lad . How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks ? Believe me , sir , they butt together well . Head and butt ! a hasty-witted body Would say your head and butt were head and horn . Ay , mistress bride , hath that awaken'd you ? Ay , but not frighted me ; therefore I'll sleep again . Nay , that you shall not ; since you have begun , Have at you for a bitter jest or two . Am I your bird ? I mean to shift my bush ; And then pursue me as you draw your bow . You are welcome all . She hath prevented me . Here , Signior Tranio ; This bird you aim'd at , though you hit her not : Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd . O sir ! Lucentio slipp'd me , like his greyhound , Which runs himself , and catches for his master . A good swift simile , but something currish . 'Tis well , sir , that you hunted for yourself : 'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay . O ho , Petruchio ! Tranio hits you now . I thank thee for that gird , good Tranio . Confess , confess , hath he not hit you here ? A' has a little gall'd me , I confess ; And , as the jest did glance away from me , 'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright . Now , in good sadness , son Petruchio , I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all . Well , I say no : and therefore , for assurance , Let's each one send unto his wife ; And he whose wife is most obedient To come at first when he doth send for her , Shall win the wager which we will propose . Content . What is the wager ? Twenty crowns . Twenty crowns ! I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound , But twenty times so much upon my wife . A hundred then . Content . A match ! 'tis done . Who shall begin ? That will I . Go , Biondello , bid your mistress come to me . I go . Son , I will be your half , Bianca comes . I'll have no halves ; I'll bear it all myself . How now ! what news ? Sir , my mistress sends you word That she is busy and she cannot come . How ! she is busy , and she cannot come ! Is that an answer ? Ay , and a kind one too : Pray God , sir , your wife send you not a worse . I hope , better . Sirrah Biondello , go and entreat my wife To come to me forthwith . O ho ! entreat her ! Nay , then she must needs come . I am afraid , sir , Do what you can , yours will not be entreated . Now , where's my wife ? She says you have some goodly jest in hand : She will not come : she bids you come to her . Worse and worse ; she will not come ! O vile , Intolerable , not to be endur'd ! Sirrah Grumio , go to your mistress ; say , I command her come to me . I know her answer . What ? She will not . The fouler fortune mine , and there an end . Now , by my holidame , here comes Katharina ! What is your will , sir , that you send for me ? Where is your sister , and Hortensio's wife ? They sit conferring by the parlour fire . Go , fetch them hither : if they deny to come , Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands . Away , I say , and bring them hither straight . Here is a wonder , if you talk of a wonder . And so it is . I wonder what it bodes . Marry , peace it bodes , and love , and quiet life , An awful rule and right supremacy ; And , to be short , what not that's sweet and happy . Now fair befall thee , good Petruchio ! The wager thou hast won ; and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns ; Another dowry to another daughter , For she is chang'd , as she had never been . Nay , I will win my wager better yet , And show more sign of her obedience , Her new-built virtue and obedience . See where she comes , and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion . Katharine , that cap of yours becomes you not : Off with that bauble , throw it under foot . Lord ! let me never have a cause to sigh , Till I be brought to such a silly pass ! Fie ! what a foolish duty call you this ? I would your duty were as foolish too : The wisdom of your duty , fair Bianca , Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time . The more fool you for laying on my duty . Katharine , I charge thee , tell these headstrong women What duty they do owe their lords and husbands . Come , come , you're mocking : we will have no telling . Come on , I say ; and first begin with her . She shall not . I say she shall : and first begin with her . Fie , fie ! unknit that threatening unkind brow , And dart not scornful glances from those eyes , To wound thy lord , thy king , thy governor : It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads , Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds , And in no sense is meet or amiable . A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled , Muddy , ill-seeming , thick , bereft of beauty ; And while it is so , none so dry or thirsty Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it . Thy husband is thy lord , thy life , thy keeper , Thy head , thy sovereign ; one that cares for thee , And for thy maintenance commits his body To painful labour both by sea and land , To watch the night in storms , the day in cold , Whilst thou liest warm at home , secure and safe ; And craves no other tribute at thy hands But love , fair looks , and true obedience ; Too little payment for so great a debt . Such duty as the subject owes the prince , Even such a woman oweth to her husband ; And when she's froward , peevish , sullen , sour , And not obedient to his honest will , What is she but a foul contending rebel , And graceless traitor to her loving lord ? I am asham'd that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace , Or seek for rule , supremacy , and sway , When they are bound to serve , love , and obey . Why are our bodies soft , and weak , and smooth , Unapt to toil and trouble in the world , But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts ? Come , come , you froward and unable worms ! My mind hath been as big as one of yours , My heart as great , my reason haply more , To bandy word for word and frown for frown ; But now I see our lances are but straws , Our strength as weak , our weakness past compare , That seeming to be most which we indeed least are . Then vail your stomachs , for it is no boot , And place your hands below your husband's foot : In token of which duty , if he please , My hand is ready ; may it do him ease . Why , there's a wench ! Come on , and kiss me , Kate . Well , go thy ways , old lad , for thou shalt ha't . 'Tis a good hearing when children are toward . But a harsh hearing when women are froward . Come , Kate , we'll to bed . We three are married , but you two are sped . 'Twas I won the wager , though you hit the white ; And , being a winner , God give you good night ! Now , go thy ways ; thou hast tam'd a curst shrew . 'Tis a wonder , by your leave , she will be tam'd so .
