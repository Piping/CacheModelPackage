When icicles hang by the wall , And Dick the shepherd blows his nail , And Tom bears logs into the hall , And milk comes frozen home in pail , When blood is nipp'd , and ways be foul , Then nightly sings the staring owl , Tu-who ; Tu-whit , tu-who a merry note , While greasy Joan doth keel the pot .
