Nay , but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure ; those his goodly eyes , That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glow'd like plated Mars , now bend , now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front ; his captain's heart , Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast , reneges all temper , And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gipsy's lust . Look ! where they come . Take but good note , and you shall see in him The triple pillar of the world transform'd Into a strumpet's fool ; behold and see . If it be love indeed , tell me how much . There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd . I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd . Then must thou needs find out new heaven , new earth . News , my good lord , from Rome . Grates me ; the sum . Nay , hear them , Antony : Fulvia , perchance , is angry ; or , who knows If the scarce-bearded C sar have not sent His powerful mandate to you , 'Do this , or this ; Take in that kingdom , and enfranchise that ; Perform 't , or else we damn thee .' How , my love ! Perchance ! nay , and most like ; You must not stay here longer ; your dismission Is come from C sar ; therefore hear it , Antony . Where's Fulvia's process ? C sar's I would say ? both ? Call in the messengers . As I am Egypt's queen , Thou blushest , Antony , and that blood of thine Is C sar's homager ; else so thy cheek pays shame When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds . The messengers ! Let Rome in Tiber melt , and the wide arch Of the rang'd empire fall ! Here is my space . Kingdoms are clay ; our dungy earth alike Feeds beast as man ; the nobleness of life Is to do thus ; when such a mutual pair And such a twain can do 't , in which I bind , On pain of punishment , the world to weet We stand up peerless . Excellent falsehood ! Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her ? I'll seem the fool I am not ; Antony Will be himself . But stirr'd by Cleopatra . Now , for the love of Love and her soft hours , Let's not confound the time with conference harsh : There's not a minute of our lives should stretch Without some pleasure now . What sport to-night ? Hear the ambassadors . Fie , wrangling queen ! Whom every thing becomes , to chide , to laugh , To weep ; whose every passion fully strives To make itself , in thee , fair and admir'd . No messenger , but thine ; and all alone , To-night we'll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people . Come , my queen ; Last night you did desire it : speak not to us . Is C sar with Antonius priz'd so slight ? Sir , sometimes , when he is not Antony , He comes too short of that great property Which still should go with Antony . I am full sorry That he approves the common liar , who Thus speaks of him at Rome ; but I will hope Of better deeds to-morrow . Rest you happy ! Lord Alexas , sweet Alexas , most any thing Alexas , almost most absolute Alexas , where's the soothsayer that you praised so to the queen ? O ! that I knew this husband , which , you say , must charge his horns with garlands . Soothsayer ! Your will ? Is this the man ? Is't you , sir , that know things ? In nature's infinite book of secrecy A little I can read . Show him your hand . Bring in the banquet quickly ; wine enough Cleopatra's health to drink . Good sir , give me good fortune . I make not , but foresee . Pray then , foresee me one . You shall be yet far fairer than you are . He means in flesh . No , you shall paint when you are old . Wrinkles forbid ! Vex not his prescience ; be attentive . Hush ! You shall be more beloving than belov'd . I had rather heat my liver with drinking . Nay , hear him . Good now , some excellent fortune ! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon , and widow them all ; let me have a child at fifty , to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage ; find me to marry me with Octavius C sar , and companion me with my mistress . You shall outlive the lady whom you serve . O excellent ! I love long life better than figs . You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune Than that which is to approach . Then , belike , my children shall have no names ; prithee , how many boys and wenches must I have ? If every of your wishes had a womb , And fertile every wish , a million . Out , fool ! I forgive thee for a witch . You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes . Nay , come , tell Iras hers . We'll know all our fortunes . Mine , and most of our fortunes , to-night , shall be ,drunk to bed . There's a palm presages chastity , if nothing else . E'en as the overflowing Nilus presageth famine . Go , you wild bedfellow , you cannot soothsay . Nay , if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication , I cannot scratch mine ear . Prithee , tell her but a worky-day fortune . Your fortunes are alike . But how ? but how ? give me particulars . I have said . Am I not an inch of fortune better than she ? Well , if you were but an inch of fortune better than I , where would you choose it ? Not in my husband's nose . Our worser thoughts heaven mend ! Alexas ,come , his fortune , his fortune . O ! let him marry a woman that cannot go , sweet Isis , I beseech thee ; and let her die too , and give him a worse ; and let worse follow worse , till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave , fifty-fold a cuckold ! Good Isis , hear me this prayer , though thou deny me a matter of more weight ; good Isis , I beseech thee ! Amen . Dear goddess , hear that prayer of the people ! for , as it is a heart-breaking to see a handsome man loose-wived , so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded : therefore , dear Isis , keep decorum , and fortune him accordingly ! Amen . Lo , now ! if it lay in their hands to make me acuckold , they would make themselves whores , but they'd do't ! Hush ! here comes Antony . Not he ; the queen . Saw you my lord ? No , lady . Was he not here ? No , madam . He was dispos'd to mirth ; but on the sudden A Roman thought hath struck him . Enobarbus ! Madam ! Seek him , and bring him hither . Where's Alexas ? Here , at your service . My lord approaches . We will not look upon him ; go with us . Fulvia thy wife first came into the field . Against my brother Lucius ? Ay : But soon that war had end , and the time's state Made friends of them , jointing their force 'gainst C sar , Whose better issue in the war , from Italy Upon the first encounter drave them . Well , what worst ? The nature of bad news infects the teller . When it concerns the fool , or coward . On ; Things that are past are done with me . 'Tis thus : Who tells me true , though in his tale lay death , I hear him as he flatter'd . Labienus This is stiff news hath , with his Parthian force Extended Asia ; from Euphrates His conquering banner shook from Syria To Lydia and to Ionia : whilst Antony , thou wouldst say , O ! my lord . Speak to me home , mince not the general tongue ; Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome ; Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase ; and taunt my faults With such full licence as both truth and malice Have power to utter . O ! then we bring forth weeds When our quick winds lie still ; and our ills told us Is as our earing . Fare thee well awhile . At your noble pleasure . From Sicyon , ho , the news ! Speak there ! The man from Sicyon , is there such an one ? He stays upon your will . Let him appear . These strong Egyptian fetters I must break , Or lose myself in dotage . What are you ? Fulvia thy wife is dead . Where died she ? In Sicyon : Her length of sickness , with what else more serious Importeth thee to know , this bears . Forbear me . There's a great spirit gone ! Thus did I desire it : What our contempts do often hurl from us We wish it ours again ; the present pleasure , By revolution lowering , does become The opposite of itself : she's good , being gone ; The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on . I must from this enchanting queen break off ; Ten thousand harms , more than the ills I know , My idleness doth hatch . How now ! Enobarbus ! What's your pleasure , sir ? I must with haste from hence . Why , then , we kill all our women . We see how mortal an unkindness is to them ; if they suffer our departure , death's the word . I must be gone . Under a compelling occasion let women die ; it were pity to cast them away for nothing ; though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing . Cleopatra , catching but the least noise of this , dies instantly ; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment . I do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her , she hath such a celerity in dying . She is cunning past man's thought . Alack ! sir , no ; her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love . We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears ; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report : this cannot be cunning in her ; if it be , she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove . Would I had never seen her ! O , sir ! you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel . Fulvia is dead . Sir ? Fulvia is dead . Fulvia ! Dead . Why , sir , give the gods a thankful sacrifice . When it pleaseth their de ties to take the wife of a man from him , it shows to man the tailors of the earth ; comforting therein , that when old robes are worn out , there are members to make new . If there were no more women but Fulvia , then had you indeed a cut , and the case to be lamented : this grief is crowned with consolation ; your old smock brings forth a new petticoat ; and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow . The business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absence . And the business you have broached here cannot be without you ; especially that of Cleopatra's , which wholly depends on your abode . No more light answers . Let our officers Have notice what we purpose . I shall break The cause of our expedience to the queen , And get her leave to part . For not alone The death of Fulvia , with more urgent touches , Do strongly speak to us , but the letters too Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home . Sextus Pompeius Hath given the dare to C sar , and commands The empire of the sea ; our slippery people Whose love is never link'd to the deserver Till his deserts are past begin to throw Pompey the Great and all his dignities Upon his son ; who , high in name and power , Higher than both in blood and life , stands up For the main soldier , whose quality , going on , The sides o' the world may danger . Much is breeding , Which , like the courser's hair , hath yet but life , And not a serpent's poison . Say , our pleasure , To such whose place is under us , requires Our quick remove from hence . I shall do it . Where is he ? I did not see him since . See where he is , who's with him , what he does ; I did not send you : if you find him sad , Say I am dancing ; if in mirth , report That I am sudden sick : quick , and return . Madam , methinks , if you did love him dearly , You do not hold the method to enforce The like from him . What should I do I do not ? In each thing give him way , cross him in nothing . Thou teachest like a fool ; the way to lose him . Tempt him not so too far ; I wish , forbear : In time we hate that which we often fear . But here comes Antony . I am sick and sullen . I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose , Help me away , dear Charmian , I shall fall : It cannot be thus long , the sides of nature Will not sustain it . Now , my dearest queen , Pray you , stand further from me . What's the matter ? I know , by that same eye , there's some good news . What says the married woman ? You may go : Would she had never given you leave to come ! Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here ; I have no power upon you ; hers you are . The gods best know , O ! never was there queen So mightily betray'd ; yet at the first I saw the treasons planted . Cleopatra , Why should I think you can be mine and true , Though you in swearing shake the throned gods , Who have been false to Fulvia ? Riotous madness , To be entangled with those mouth-made vows , Which break themselves in swearing ! Most sweet queen , Nay , pray you , seek no colour for your going , But bid farewell , and go : when you su'd staying Then was the time for words ; no going then : Eternity was in our lips and eyes , Bliss in our brows bent ; none our parts so poor But was a race of heaven ; they are so still , Or thou , the greatest soldier of the world , Art turn'd the greatest liar . How now , lady ! I would I had thy inches ; thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt . Hear me , queen : The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile , but my full heart Remains in use with you . Our Italy Shines o'er with civil swords ; Sextus Pompeius Makes his approaches to the port of Rome ; Equality of two domestic powers Breeds scrupulous faction . The hated , grown to strength , Are newly grown to love ; the condemn'd Pompey , Rich in his father's honour , creeps apace Into the hearts of such as have not thriv'd Upon the present state , whose numbers threaten ; And quietness , grown aick of rest , would purge By any desperate change . My more particular , And that which most with you should safe my going , Is Fulvia's death . Though age from folly could not give me freedom , It does from childishness : can Fulvia die ? She's dead , my queen : Look here , and at thy sovereign leisure read The garboils she awak'd ; at the last , best , See when and where she died . O most false love ! Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water ? Now I see , I see , In Fulvia's death , how mine receiv'd shall be . Quarrel no more , but be prepar'd to know The purposes I bear , which are or cease As you shall give the advice . By the fire That quickens Nilus' slime , I go from hence Thy soldier , servant , making peace or war As thou affect'st . Cut my lace , Charmian , come ; But let it be : I am quickly ill , and well ; So Antony loves . My precious queen , forbear , And give true evidence to his love which stands An honourable trial . So Fulvia told me . I prithee , turn aside and weep for her ; Then bid adieu to me , and say the tears Belong to Egypt : good now , play one scene Of excellent dissembling , and let it look Like perfect honour . You'll heat my blood ; no more . You can do better yet , but this is meetly . Now , by my sword , And target . Still he mends ; But this is not the best . Look , prithee , Charmian , How this Herculean Roman does become The carriage of his chafe . I'll leave you , lady . Courteous lord , one word . Sir , you and I must part , but that 's not it : Sir , you and I have lov'd , but there 's not it ; That you know well : something it is I would , O ! my oblivion is a very Antony , And I am all forgotten . But that your royalty Holds idleness your subject , I should take you For idleness itself . 'Tis sweating labour To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this . But , sir , forgive me ; Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you : your honour calls you hence ; Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly , And all the gods go with you ! Upon your sword Sit laurel victory ! and smooth success Be strew'd before your feet ! Let us go . Come ; Our separation so abides and flies , That thou , residing here , go'st yet with me , And I , hence fleeting , here remain with thee . Away ! You may see , Lepidus , and henceforth know , It is not C sar's natural vice to hate Our great competitor . From Alexandria This is the news : he fishes , drinks , and wastes The lamps of night in revel ; is not more manlike Than Cleopatra , nor the queen of Ptolemy More womanly than he ; hardly gave audience , or Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners : you shall find there A man who is the abstract of all faults That all men follow . I must not think there are Evils enow to darken all his goodness ; His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven , More fiery by night's blackness ; hereditary Rather than purchas'd ; what he cannot change Than what he chooses . You are too indulgent . Let us grant it is not Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy , To give a kingdom for a mirth , to sit And keep the turn of tippling with a slave , To reel the streets at noon , and stand the buffet With knaves that smell of sweat ; say this becomes him , As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemish ,yet must Antony No way excuse his soils , when we do bear So great weight in his lightness . If he fill'd His vacancy with his voluptuousness , Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him for 't ; but to confound such time That drums him from his sport , and speaks as loud As his own state and ours , 'tis to be chid As we rate boys , who , being mature in knowledge , Pawn their experience to their present pleasure , And so rebel to judgment . Here's more news . Thy biddings have been done , and every hour , Most noble C sar , shalt thou have report How 'tis abroad . Pompey is strong at sea , And it appears he is belov'd of those That only have fear'd C sar ; to the ports The discontents repair , and men's reports Give him much wrong'd . I should have known no less . It hath been taught us from the primal state , That he which is was wish'd until he were ; And the ebb'd man , ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love , Comes dear'd by being lack'd . This common body , Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream , Goes to and back , lackeying the varying tide , To rot itself with motion . C sar , I bring thee word , Menecrates and Menas , famous pirates , Make the sea serve them , which they ear and wound With keels of every kind : many hot inroads They make in Italy ; the borders maritime Lack blood to think on't , and flush youth revolt ; No vessel can peep forth , but 'tis as soon Taken as seen ; for Pompey's name strikes more Than could his war resisted . Antony , Leave thy lascivious wassails . When thou once Wast beaten from Modena , where thou slew'st Hirtius and Pansa , consuls , at thy heel Did famine follow , whom thou fought'st against , Though daintily brought up , with patience more Than savages could suffer ; thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at ; thy palate then did deign The roughest berry on the rudest hedge ; Yea , like the stag , when snow the pasture sheets , The barks of trees thou browsed'st ; on the Alps It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh , Which some did die to look on ; and all this It wounds thy honour that I speak it now Was borne so like a soldier , that thy cheek So much as lank'd not . 'Tis pity of him . Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome . 'Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i' the field ; and to that end Assemble me immediate council ; Pompey Thrives in our idleness . To-morrow , C sar , I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time . Till which encounter , It is my business too . Farewell . Farewell , my lord . What you shall know meantime Of stirs abroad , I shall beseech you , sir , To let me be partaker . Doubt not , sir ; I knew it for my bond . Charmian ! Madam ! Ha , ha ! Give me to drink mandragora . Why , madam ? That I might sleep out this great gap of time My Antony is away . You think of him too much . O ! 'tis treason . Madam , I trust , not so . Thou , eunuch Mardian ! What 's your highness' pleasure ? Not now to hear thee sing ; I take no pleasure In aught a eunuch has . 'Tis well for thee , That , being unseminar'd , thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt . Hast thou affections ? Yes , gracious madam . Indeed ! Not in deed , madam ; for I can do nothing But what in deed is honest to be done ; Yet have I fierce affections , and think What Venus did with Mars . O Charmian ! Where think'st thou he is now ? Stands he , or sits he ? Or does he walk ? or is he on his horse ? O happy horse , to bear the weight of Antony ! Do bravely , horse , for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st ? The demi-Atlas of this earth , the arm And burgonet of men . He's speaking now , Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile ?' For so he calls me . Now I feed myself With most delicious poison . Think on me , That am with Ph bus' amorous pinches black , And wrinkled deep in time ? Broad-fronted C sar , When thou wast here above the ground I was A morsel for a monarch , and great Pompey Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow ; There would he anchor his aspect and die With looking on his life . Sovereign of Egypt , hail ! How much unlike art thou Mark Antony ! Yet , coming from him , that great medicine hath With his tinct gilded thee . How goes it with my brave Mark Antony ? Last thing he did , dear queen , He kiss'd , the last of many doubled kisses , This orient pearl . His speech sticks in my heart . Mine ear must pluck it thence . 'Good friend ,' quoth he , 'Say , the firm Roman to great Egypt sends This treasure of an oyster ; at whose foot , To mend the petty present , I will piece Her opulent throne with kingdoms ; all the east , Say thou , shall call her mistress .' So he nodded , And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed , Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumb'd by him . What ! was he sad or merry ? Like to the time o' the year between the extremes Of hot and cold ; he was nor sad nor merry . O well-divided disposition ! Note him , Note him , good Charmian , 'tis the man ; but note him : He was not sad , for he would shire on those That make their looks by his ; he was not merry , Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy ; but between both : O heavenly mingle ! Be'st thou sad or merry , The violence of either thee becomes , So does it no man else . Mett'st thou my posts ? Ay , madam , twenty several messengers . Why do you send so thick ? Who's born that day When I forget to send to Antony , Shall die a beggar . Ink and paper , Charmian . Welcome , my good Alexas . Did I , Charmian , Ever love C sar so ? O ! that brave C sar . Be chok'd with such another emphasis ! Say the brave Antony . The valiant C sar ! By Isis , I will give thee bloody teeth , If thou with C sar paragon again My man of men . By your most gracious pardon , I sing but after you . My salad days , When I was green in judgment , cold in blood , To say as I said then ! But come , away ; Get me ink and paper : He shall have every day a several greeting , Or I'll unpeople Egypt . If the great gods be just , they shall assist The deeds of justest men . Know , worthy Pompey , That what they do delay , they not deny . Whiles we are suitors to their throne , decays The thing we sue for . We , ignorant of ourselves , Beg often our own harms , which the wise powers Deny us for our good ; so find we profit By losing of our prayers . I shall do well : The people love me , and the sea is mine ; My powers are crescent , and my auguring hope Says it will come to the full . Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner , and will make No wars without doors ; C sar gets money where He loses hearts ; Lepidus flatters both , Of both is flatter'd ; but he neither loves , Nor either cares for him . C sar and Lepidus Are in the field ; a mighty strength they carry . Where have you this ? 'tis false . From Silvius , sir . He dreams ; I know they are in Rome together , Looking for Antony . But all the charms of love , Salt Cleopatra , soften thy wan'd lip ! Let witchcraft join with beauty , lust with both ! Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts , Keep his brain fuming ; Epicurean cooks Sharpen with cloyless sance his appetite , That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour Even till a Lethe'd dulness ! How now , Varrius ! This is most certain that I shall deliver : Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected ; since he went from Egypt 'tis A space for further travel . I could have given less matter A better ear . Menas , I did not think This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm For such a petty war ; his soldiership Is twice the other twain . But let us rear The higher our opinion , that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony . I cannot hope C sar and Antony shall well greet together ; His wife that's dead did trespasses to C sar , His brother warr'd upon him , although I think Not mov'd by Antony . I know not , Menas , How lesser enmities may give way to greater . Were 't not that we stand up against them all 'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves , For they have entertained cause enough To draw their swords ; but how the fear of us May cement their divisions and bind up The petty difference , we yet not know . Be it as our gods will have 't ! It only stands Our lives upon , to use our strongest hands . Come , Menas . Good Enobarbus , 'tis a worthy deed , And shall become you well , to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech . I shall entreat him To answer like himself : if C sar move him , Let Antony look over C sar's head , And speak as loud as Mars . By Jupiter , Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard , I would not shave 't to-day . 'Tis not a time For private stomaching . Every time Serves for the matter that is then born in 't . But small to greater matters must give way . Not if the small come first . Your speech is passion ; But , pray you , stir no embers up . Here comes The noble Antony . And yonder , C sar . If we compose well here , to Parthia : Hark ye , Ventidius . I do not know , Mec nas ; ask Agrippa . Noble friends , That which combin'd us was most great , and let not A leaner action rend us . What's amiss , May it be gently heard ; when we debate Our trivial difference loud , we do commit Murder in healing wounds ; then , noble partners , The rather for I earnestly beseech , Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms , Nor curstness grow to the matter . 'Tis spoken well . Were we before our armies , and to fight , I should do thus . Welcome to Rome . Thank you . Sit . Sit , sir . Nay , then . I learn , you take things ill which are not so , Or being , concern you not . I must be laugh'd at If , or for nothing or a little , I Should say myself offended , and with you Chiefly i' the world ; more laugh'd at that I should Once name you derogately , when to sound your name It not concern'd me . My being in Egypt , C sar , What was 't to you ? No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt ; yet , if you there Did practise on my state , your being in Egypt Might be my question . How intend you , practis'd ? You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me . Your wife and brother Made wars upon me , and their contestation Was theme for you , you were the word of war . You do mistake your business ; my brother never Did urge me in his act : I did inquire it ; And have my learning from some true reports , That drew their swords with you . Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours , And make the wars alike against my stomach , Having alike your cause ? Of this my letters Before did satisfy you . If you'll patch a quarrel , As matter whole you n' have to make it with , It must not be with this . You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me , but You patch'd up your excuses . Not so , not so ; I know you could not lack , I am certain on 't , Very necessity of this thought , that I , Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought , Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace . As for my wife , I would you had her spirit in such another : The third o' the world is yours , which with a snaffle You may pace easy , but not such a wife . Would we had all such wives , that the men might go to wars with the women ! So much uncurbable , her garboils , C sar , Made out of her impatience ,which not wanted Shrewdness of policy too ,I grieving grant Did you too much disquiet ; for that you must But say I could not help it . I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria ; you Did pocket up my letters , and with taunts Did gibe my missive out of audience . Sir , He fell upon me , ere admitted : then Three kings I had newly feasted , and did want Of what I was i' the morning ; but next day I told him of myself , which was as much As to have ask'd him pardon . Let this fellow Be nothing of our strife ; if we contend , Out of our question wipe him . You have broken The article of your oath , which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with . Soft , C sar ! No , Lepidus , let him speak : The honour's sacred which he talks on now , Supposing that I lack'd it . But on , C sar ; The article of my oath . To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them , The which you both denied . Neglected , rather ; And then , when poison'd hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge . As nearly as I may , I'll play the penitent to you ; but mine honesty Shall not make poor my greatness , nor my power Work without it . Truth is , that Fulvia , To have me out of Egypt , made wars here ; For which myself , the ignorant motive , do So far ask pardon as befits mine honour To stoop in such a case . 'Tis noble spoken . If it might please you , to enforce no further The griefs between ye : to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you . Worthily spoken , Mec nas . Or , if you borrow one another's love for the instant , you may , when you hear no more words of Pompey , return it again : you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do . Thou art a soldier only ; speak no more . That truth should be silent I had almost forgot . You wrong this presence ; therefore speak no more . Go to , then ; your considerate stone . I do not much dislike the matter , but The manner of his speech ; for it cannot be We shall remain in friendship , our conditions So differing in their acts . Yet , if I knew What hoop should hold us stanch , from edge to edge O' the world I would pursue it . Give me leave , C sar . Speak , Agrippa . Thou hast a sister by the mother's side , Admir'd Octavia ; great Mark Antony Is now a widower . Say not so , Agrippa : If Cleopatra heard you , your reproof Were well deserv'd of rashness . I am not married , C sar ; let me hear Agrippa further speak . To hold you in perpetual amity , To make you brothers , and to knit your hearts With an unslipping knot , take Antony Octavia to his wife ; whose beauty claims No worse a husband than the best of men , Whose virtue and whose general graces speak That which none else can utter . By this marriage , All little jealousies which now seem great , And all great fears which now import their dangers , Would then be nothing ; truths would be but tales Where now half tales be truths ; her love to both Would each to other and all loves to both Draw after her . Pardon what I have spoke , For 'tis a studied , not a present thought , By duty ruminated . Will C sar speak ? Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd With what is spoke already . What power is in Agrippa , If I would say , 'Agrippa , be it so ,' To make this good ? The power of C sar , and His power unto Octavia . May I never To this good purpose , that so fairly shows , Dream of impediment ! Let me have thy hand ; Further this act of grace , and from this hour The heart of brothers govern in our loves And sway our great designs ! There is my hand . A sister I bequeath you , whom no brother Did ever love so dearly ; let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts , and never Fly off our loves again ! Happily , amen ! I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey , For he hath laid strange courtesies and great Of late upon me ; I must thank him only , Lest my remembrance suffer ill report ; At heel of that , defy him . Time calls upon 's : Of us must Pompey presently be sought , Or else he seeks out us . Where lies he ? About the Mount Misenum . What's his strength By land ? Great and increasing ; but by sea He is an absolute master . So is the fame . Would we had spoke together ! Haste we for it ; Yet , ere we put ourselves in arms , dispatch we The business we have talk'd of . With most gladness ; And do invite you to my sister's view , Whither straight I'll lead you . Let us , Lepidus , Not lack your company . Noble Antony , Not sickness should detain me . Welcome from Egypt , sir . Half the heart of C sar , worthy Mec nas ! My honourable friend , Agrippa ! Good Enobarbus ! We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested . You stayed well by 't in Egypt . Ay , sir ; we did sleep day out of countenance , and made the night light with drinking . Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast , and but twelve persons there ; is this true ? This was but as a fly by an eagle ; we had much more monstrous matter of feast , which worthily deserved noting . She's a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her . When she first met Mark Antony she pursed up his heart , upon the river of Cydnus . There she appeared indeed , or my reporter devised well for her . I will tell you . The barge she sat in , like a burnish'd throne , Burn'd on the water ; the poop was beaten gold , Purple the sails , and so perfumed , that The winds were love-sick with them , the oars were silver , Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke , and made The water which they beat to follow faster , As amorous of their strokes . For her own person , It beggar'd all description ; she did lie In her pavilion ,cloth-of-gold of tissue , O'er-picturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature ; on each side her Stood pretty-dimpled boys , like smiling Cupids , With divers-colour'd fans , whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool , And what they undid did . O ! rare for Antony . Her gentlewomen , like the Nereides , So many mermaids , tended her i' the eyes , And made their bends adornings ; at the helm A seeming mermaid steers ; the silken tackle Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands , That yarely frame the office . From the barge A strange invisible perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs . The city cast Her people out upon her , and Antony , Enthron'd i' the market-place , did sit alone , Whistling to the air ; which , but for vacancy , Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too And made a gap in nature . Rare Egyptian ! Upon her landing , Antony sent to her , Invited her to supper ; she replied It should be better he became her guest , Which she entreated . Our courteous Antony , Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak , Being barber'd ten times o'er , goes to the feast , And , for his ordinary pays his heart For what his eyes eat only . Royal wench ! She made great C sar lay his sword to bed ; He plough'd her , and she cropp'd . I saw her once Hop forty paces through the public street ; And having lost her breath , she spoke , and panted That she did make defect perfection , And , breathless , power breathe forth . Now Antony must leave her utterly . Never ; he will not : Age cannot wither her , nor custom stale Her infinite variety ; other women cloy The appetites they feed , but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies ; for vilest things Become themselves in her , that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish . If beauty , wisdom , modesty , can settle The heart of Antony , Octavia is A blessed lottery to him . Let us go . Good Enobarbus , make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here . Humbly , sir , I thank you . The world and my great office will sometimes Divide me from your bosom . All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you . Good night , sir . My Octavia , Read not my blemishes in the world's report ; I have not kept my square , but that to come Shall all be done by the rule . Good night , dear lady . Good night , sir . Good night . Now , sirrah ; you do wish yourself in Egypt ? Would I had never come from thence , nor you Thither ! If you can , your reason ? I see it in My motion , have it not in my tongue : but yet Hie you to Egypt again . Say to me , Whose fortunes shall rise higher , C sar's or mine ? C sar's . Therefore , O Antony ! stay not by his side ; Thy demon that's thy spirit which keeps thee ,is Noble , courageous , high , unmatchable , Where C sar's is not ; but near him thy angel Becomes a fear , as being o'erpower'd ; therefore Make space enough between you . Speak this no more . To none but thee ; no more but when to thee . If thou dost play with him at any game Thou art sure to lose , and , of that natural luck , He beats thee 'gainst the odds ; thy lustre thickens When he shines by . I say again , thy spirit Is all afraid to govern thee near him , But he away , 'tis noble . Get thee gone : Say to Ventidius I would speak with him . He shall to Parthia . Be it art or hap He hath spoken true ; the very dice obey him . And in our sports my better cunning faints Under his chance ; if we draw lots he speeds , His cocks do win the battle still of mine When it is all to nought , and his quails ever Beat mine , inhoop'd , at odds . I will to Egypt ; And though I make this marriage for my peace , I' the east my pleasure lies . O ! come , Ventidius , You must to Parthia ; your commission's ready ; Follow me , and receive 't . Trouble yourselves no further ; pray you hasten Your generals after . Sir , Mark Antony Will e'en but kiss Octavia , and we'll follow . Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress , Which will become you both , farewell . We shall , As I conceive the journey , be at the Mount Before you , Lepidus . Your way is shorter ; My purposes to draw me much about : You 'll win two days upon me . Sir , good success ! Sir , good success ! Farewell . Give me some music ; music , moody food Of us that trade in love . The music , ho ! Let it alone ; let 's to billiards : come , Charmian . My arm is sore ; best play with Mardian . As well a woman with a eunuch play'd As with a woman . Come , you 'll play with me , sir ? As well as I can , madam . And when good will is show'd , though't come too short , The actor may plead pardon . I 'll none now . Give me mine angle ; we'll to the river : there My music playing far off I will betray Tawny-finn'd fishes ; my bended hook shall pierce Their slimy jaws ; and , as I draw them up , I'll think them every one an Antony , And say , 'Ah , ha !' you're caught . 'Twas merry when You wager'd on your angling ; when your diver Did hang a salt-fish on his hook , which he With fervency drew up . That time O times ! I laugh'd him out of patience ; and that night I laugh'd him into patience : and next morn , Ere the ninth hour , I drunk him to his bed ; Then put my tires and mantles on him , whilst I wore his sword Philippan . O ! from Italy ; Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears , That long time have been barren . Madam , madam , Antony's dead ! if thou say so , villain , Thou kill'st thy mistress ; but well and free , If thou so yield him , there is gold , and here My bluest veins to kiss ; a hand that kings Have lipp'd , and trembled kissing . First , madam , he is well . Why , there's more gold . But , sirrah , mark , we use To say the dead are well : bring it to that , The gold I give thee will I melt , and pour Down thy ill-uttering throat . Good madam , hear me . Well , go to , I will ; But there's no goodness in thy face ; if Antony Be free and healthful , so tart a favour To trumpet such good tidings ! if not well , Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes , Not like a formal man . Will't please you hear me ? I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st : Yet , if thou say Antony lives , is well , Or friends with C sar , or not captive to him , I'll set thee in a shower of gold , and hail Rich pearls upon thee . Madam , he's well . Well said . And friends with C sar . Thou'rt an honest man . C sar and he are greater friends than ever . Make thee a fortune from me . But yet , madam , I do not like 'but yet ,' it does allay The good precedence ; fie upon 'but yet !' 'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor . Prithee , friend , Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear , The good and bad together . He's friends with C sar ; In state of health , thou sayst ; and thou sayst , free . Free , madam ! no ; I made no such report : He's bound unto Octavia . For what good turn ? For the best turn i' the bed . I am pale , Charmian ! Madam , he's married to Octavia . The most infectious pestilence upon thee ! Good madam , patience . What say you ? Hence , Horrible villain ! or I'll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me ; I'll unhair thy head : Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire , and stew'd in brine , Smarting in lingering pickle . Gracious madam , I , that do bring the news made not the match . Say 'tis not so , a province I will give thee , And make thy fortunes proud ; the blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage , And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg . He's married , madam . Rogue ! thou hast liv'd too long . Nay , then I'll run . What mean you , madam ? I have made no fault . Good madam , keep yourself within yourself ; The man is innocent . Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt . Melt Egypt into Nile ! and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents ! Call the slave again : Though I am mad , I will not bite him . Call . He is afeard to come . I will not hurt him . These hands do lack nobility , that they strike A meaner than myself ; since I myself Have given myself the cause . Come hither , sir . Though it be honest , it is never good To bring bad news ; give to a gracious message A host of tongues , but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt . I have done my duty . Is he married ? I cannot hate thee worser than I do If thou again say 'Yes .' He's married , madam . The gods confound thee ! dost thou hold there still ? Should I lie , madam ? O ! I would thou didst , So half my Egypt were submerg'd and made A cistern for scal'd snakes . Go , get thee hence ; Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face , to me Thou wouldst appear most ugly . He is married ? I crave your highness' pardon . He is married ? Take no offence that I would not offend you ; To punish me for what you make me do Seems much unequal ; he's married to Octavia . O ! that his fault should make a knave of thee , That art not what thou'rt sure of . Get thee hence ; The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome Are all too dear for me ; lie they upon thy hand And be undone by 'em ! Good your highness , patience . In praising Antony I have disprais'd C sar . Many times , madam . I am paid for 't now . Lead me from hence ; I faint . O Iras ! Charmian ! 'Tis no matter . Go to the fellow , good Alexas ; bid him Report the feature of Octavia , her years , Her inclination , let him not leave out The colour of her hair : bring me word quickly . Let him forever go :let him not Charmian ! Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon , The other way's a Mars . Bid you Alexas Bring me word how tall she is . Pity me , Charmian , But do not speak to me . Lead me to my chamber . Your hostages I have , so have you mine ; And we shall talk before we fight . Most meet That first we come to words , and therefore have we Our written purposes before us sent ; Which if thou hast consider'd , let us know If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword , And carry back to Sicily much tall youth That else must perish here . To you all three , The senators alone of this great world , Chief factors for the gods , I do not know Wherefore my father should revengers want , Having a son and friends ; since Julius C sar , Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted , There saw you labouring for him . What was 't That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire ? and what Made the all-honour'd , honest Roman , Brutus , With the arm'd rest , courtiers of beauteous freedom , To drench the Capitol , but that they would Have one man but a man ? And that is it Hath made me rig my navy , at whose burden The anger'd ocean foams , with which I meant To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome Cast on my noble father . Take your time . Thou canst not fear us , Pompey , with thy sails ; We 'll speak with thee at sea : at land , thou know'st How much we do o'er-count thee . At land , indeed , Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house ; But , since the cuckoo builds not for himself , Remain in 't as thou mayst . Be pleas'd to tell us For this is from the present how you take The offers we have sent you . There's the point . Which do not be entreated to , but weigh What it is worth embrac'd . And what may follow , To try a larger fortune . You have made me offer Of Sicily , Sardinia ; and I must Rid all the sea of pirates ; then , to send Measures of wheat to Rome ; this 'greed upon , To part with unhack'd edges , and bear back Our targets undinted . That's our offer . That's our offer . That's our offer . Know , then , I came before you here a man prepar'd To take this offer ; but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience . Though I lose The praise of it by telling , you must know , When C sar and your brother were at blows , Your mother came to Sicily and did find Her welcome friendly . I have heard it , Pompey ; And am well studied for a liberal thanks Which I do owe you . Let me have your hand : I did not think , sir , to have met you here . The beds i' the east are soft ; and thanks to you , That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither , For I have gain'd by 't . Since I saw you last , There is a change upon you . Well , I know not What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face , But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal . Well met here . I hope so , Lepidus . Thus we are agreed . I crave our composition may be written And seal'd between us . That 's the next to do . We'll feast each other ere we part ; and let's Draw lots who shall begin . That will I , Pompey . No , Antony , take the lot : But , first or last , your fine Egyptian cookery Shall have the fame . I have heard that Julius C sar Grew fat with feasting there . You have heard much . I have fair meanings , sir . And fair words to them . Then , so much have I heard ; And I have heard Apollodorus carried No more of that : he did so . What , I pray you ? A certain queen to C sar in a mattress . I know thee now ; how far'st thou , soldier ? Well ; And well am like to do ; for I perceive Four feasts are toward . Let me shake thy hand ; I never hated thee . I have seen thee fight , When I have envied thy behaviour . Sir , I never lov'd you much , but I ha' prais'd ye When you have well deserv'd ten times as much As I have said you did . Enjoy thy plainness , It nothing ill becomes thee . Aboard my galley I invite you all : Will you lead , lords ? Show us the way , sir . Show us the way , sir . Show us the way , sir . Come . Thy father , Pompey , would ne'er have made this treaty . You and I have known , sir . At sea , I think . We have , sir . You have done well by water . And you by land . I will praise any man that will praise me ; though it cannot be denied what I have done by land . Nor what I have done by water . Yes , something you can deny for your own safety ; you have been a great thief by sea . And you by land . There I deny my land service . But give me your hand , Menas ; if our eyes had authority , here they might take two thieves kissing . All men's faces are true , whatsoe'er their hands are . But there is never a fair woman has a true face . No slander ; they steal hearts . We came hither to fight with you . For my part , I am sorry it is turned to a drinking . Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune . If he do , sure , he cannot weep it back again . You have said , sir . We looked not for Mark Antony here : pray you , is he married to Cleopatra ? C sar's sister is called Octavia . True , sir ; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus . But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius . Pray ye , sir ? 'Tis true . Then is C sar and he for ever knit together . If I were bound to divine of this unity , I would not prophesy so . I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties . I think so too ; but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity . Octavia is of a holy , cold , and still conversation . Who would not have his wife so ? Not he that himself is not so ; which is Mark Antony . He will to his Egyptian dish again ; then , shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in C sar , and , as I said before , that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance . Antony will use his affection where it is ; he married but his occasion here . And thus it may be . Come , sir , will you aboard ? I have a health for you . I shall take it , sir : we have used our throats in Egypt . Come ; let 's away . Here they'll be , man . Some o' their plants are ill-rooted already ; the least wind i' the world will blow them down . Lepidus is high-coloured . They have made him drink alms-drink . As they pinch one another by the disposition , he cries out , 'No more ;' reconciles them to his entreaty , and himself to the drink . But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion . Why , this it is to have a name in great men's fellowship ; I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave . To be called into a huge sphere , and not to be seen to move in't , are the holes where eyes should be , which pitifully disaster the cheeks . Thus do they , sir . They take the flow o' the Nile By certain scales i' the pyramid ; they know By the height , the lowness , or the mean , if dearth Or foison follow . The higher Nilus swells The more it promises ; as it ebbs , the seedsman Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain , And shortly comes to harvest . You've strange serpents there . Ay , Lepidus . Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun ; so is your crocodile . They are so . Sit ,and some wine ! A health to Lepidus ! I am not so well as I should be , but I'll ne'er out . Not till you have slept ; I fear me you'll be in till then . Nay , certainly , I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things ; without contradiction , I have heard that . Pompey , a word . Say in mine ear ; what is't ? Forsake thy seat , I do beseech thee , captain , And bear me speak a word . Forbear me till anon . This wine for Lepidus ! What manner o' thing is your crocodile ? It is shaped , sir , like itself , and it is as broad as it hath breadth ; it is just so high as it is , and moves with it own organs ; it lives by that which nourisheth it ; and the elements once out of it , it transmigrates . What colour is it of ? Of it own colour too . 'Tis a strange serpent . 'Tis so ; and the tears of it are wet . Will this description satisfy him ? With the health that Pompey gives him , else he is a very epicure . Go hang , sir , hang ! Tell me of that ? away ! Do as I bid you . Where's this cup I call'd for ? If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me , Rise from thy stool . I think thou'rt mad . The matter ? I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes . Thou hast serv'd me with much faith . What 's else to say ? Be jolly , lords . These quick-sands , Lepidus , Keep off them , for you sink . Wilt thou be lord of all the world ? What sayst thou ? Wilt thou be lord of the whole world ? That 's twice . How should that be ? But entertain it , And though thou think me poor , I am the man Will give thee all the world . Hast thou drunk well ? No , Pompey , I have kept me from the cup . Thou art , if thou dar'st be , the earthly Jove : Whate'er the ocean pales , or sky inclips , Is thine , if thou wilt ha 't . Show me which way . These three world-sharers , these competitors , Are in thy vessel : let me cut the cable ; And , when we are put off , fall to their throats : All there is thine . Ah ! this thou shouldst have done , And not have spoke on 't . In me 'tis villany ; In thee 't had been good service . Thou must know 'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour ; Mine honour it . Repent that e'er thy tongue Hath so betray'd thine act ; being done unknown , I should have found it afterwards well done , But must condemn it now . Desist , and drink . For this , I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more . Who seeks , and will not take when once 'tis offer'd , Shall never find it more . This health to Lepidus ! Bear him ashore . I'll pledge it for him , Pompey . Here's to thee , Menas ! Enobarbus , welcome ! Fill till the cup be hid . There's a strong fellow , Menas . Why ? A' bears the third part of the world , man ; see'st not ? The third part then is drunk ; would it were all , That it might go on wheels ! Drink thou ; increase the reels . Come . This is not yet an Alexandrian feast . It ripens towards it . Strike the vessels , ho ! Here is to C sar ! I could well forbear't . It's monstrous labour , when I wash my brain , And it grows fouler . Be a child o' the time . Possess it , I'll make answer ; But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one . Ha ! my brave emperor ; Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals , And celebrate our drink ? Let 's ha 't , good soldier . Come , let 's all take hands , Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense In soft and delicate Lethe . All take hands . Make battery to our ears with the loud music ; The while I'll place you ; then the boy shall sing , The holding every man shall bear as loud As his strong sides can volley . Come , thou monarch of the vine , Plumpy Bacchus , with pink eyne ! In thy fats our cares be drown'd , With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd : Cup us , till the world go round , Cup us , till the world go round ! What would you more ? Pompey , good night . Good brother , Let me request you off ; our graver business Frowns at this levity . Gentle lords , let's part ; You see we have burnt our cheeks ; strong Enobarb Is weaker than the wine , and mine own tongue Splits what it speaks ; the wild disguise hath almost Antick'd us all . What needs more words ? Good night . Good Antony , your hand . I'll try you on the shore . And shall , sir . Give's your hand . O , Antony ! You have my father s house ,But , what ? we are friends . Come down into the boat . Take heed you fall not . Menas , I'll not on shore . No , to my cabin . These drums ! these trumpets , flutes ! what ! Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell To these great fellows : sound and be hang'd ! sound out ! Hoo ! says a' . There's my cap . Hoo ! noble captain ! come . Now , darting Parthia , art thou struck ; and now Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death Make me revenger . Bear the king's son's body Before our army . Thy Pacorus , Orodes , Pays this for Marcus Crassus . Noble Ventidius , Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm , The fugitive Parthians follow ; spur through Media , Mesopotamia , and the shelters whither The routed fly ; so thy grand captain Antony Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and Put garlands on thy head . O Silius , Silius ! I have done enough ; a lower place , note well , May make too great an act ; for learn this , Silius , Better to leave undone than by our deed Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away . C sar and Antony have ever won More in their officer than person ; Sossius , One of my place in Syria , his lieutenant , For quick accumulation of renown , Which he achiev'd by the minute , lost his favour . Who does i' the wars more than his captain can Becomes his captain's captain ; and ambition , The soldier's virtue , rather makes choice of loss Than gain which darkens him . I could do more to do Antonius good , But 'twould offend him ; and in his offence Should my performance perish . Thou hast , Ventidius , that Without the which a soldier , and his sword , Grants scarce distinction . Thou wilt write to Antony ? I'll humbly signify what in his name , That magical word of war , we have effected ; How , with his banners and his well-paid ranks , The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia We have jaded out o' the field . Where is he now ? He purposeth to Athens ; whither , with what haste The weight we must convey with 's will permit , We shall appear before him . On , there ; pass along . What ! are the brothers parted ? They have dispatch'd with Pompey ; he is gone ; The other three are sealing . Octavia weeps To part from Rome ; C sar is sad ; and Lepidus , Since Pompey's feast , as Menas says , is troubled With the green sickness . 'Tis a noble Lepidus . A very fine one . O ! how he loves C sar . Nay , but how dearly he adores Mark Antony ! C sar ? Why , he's the Jupiter of men . What's Antony ? The god of Jupiter . Spake you of C sar ? How ! the non-pareil ! O , Antony ! O thou Arabian bird ! Would you praise C sar , say , 'C sar ,' go no further . Indeed , he plied them both with excellent praises . But he loves C sar best ; yet he loves Antony . Hoo ! hearts , tongues , figures , scribes , bards , poets , cannot Think , speak , cast , write , sing , number ; hoo ! His love to Antony . But as for C sar , Kneel down , kneel down , and wonder . Both he loves . They are his shards , and he their beetle . So ; This is to horse . Adieu , noble Agrippa . Good fortune , worthy soldier , and farewell . No further , sir . You take from me a great part of myself ; Use me well in't . Sister , prove such a wife As my thoughts make thee , and as my furthest band Shall pass on thy approof . Most noble Antony , Let not the piece of virtue , which is set Betwixt us as the cement of our love To keep it builded , be the ram to batter The fortress of it ; for better might we Have lov'd without this mean , if on both parts This be not cherish'd . Make me not offended In your distrust . I have said . You shall not find , Though you be therein curious , the least cause For what you seem to fear . So , the gods keep you , And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends ! We will here part . Farewell , my dearest sister , fare thee well : The elements be kind to thee , and make Thy spirits all of comfort ! fare thee well . My noble brother ! The April's in her eyes ; it is love's spring , And these the showers to bring it on . Be cheerful . Sir , look well to my husband's house ; and What , Octavia ? I'll tell you in your ear . Her tongue will not obey her heart , nor can Her heart obey her tongue ; the swan's downfeather , That stands upon the swell at full of tide , And neither way inclines . Will C sar weep ? He has a cloud in's face . He were the worse for that were he a horse ; So is he , being a man . Why , Enobarbus , When Antony found Julius C sar dead He cried almost to roaring ; and he wept When at Philippi he found Brutus slain . That year , indeed , he was troubled with a rheum ; What willingly he did confound he wail'd , Believe 't , till I wept too . No , sweet Octavia , You shall hear from me still ; the time shall not Out-go my thinking on you . Come , sir , come ; I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love : Look , here I have you ; thus I let you go , And give you to the gods . Adieu ; be happy ! Let all the number of the stars give light To thy fair way ! Farewell , farewell ! Farewell ! Where is the fellow ? Half afeard to come . Go to , go to . Come hither , sir . Good majesty , Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you But when you are well pleas'd . That Herod's head I'll have ; but how , when Antony is gone Through whom I might command it ? Come thou near . Most gracious majesty ! Didst thou behold Octavia ? Ay , dread queen . Where ? Madam , in Rome ; I look'd her in the face , and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony . Is she as tall as me ? She is not , madam . Didst hear her speak ? is she shrill-tongu'd , or low ? Madam , I heard her speak ; she is low-voic'd . That's not so good . He cannot like her long . Like her ! O Isis ! 'tis impossible . I think so , Charmian : dull of tongue , and dwarfish ! What majesty is in her gait ? Remember , If e'er thou look'dst on majesty . She creeps ; Her motion and her station are as one ; She shows a body rather than a life , A statue than a breather . Is this certain ? Or I have no observance . Three in Egypt Cannot make better note . He's very knowing , I do perceive 't . There's nothing in her yet . The fellow has good judgment . Excellent . Guess at her years , I prithee . Madam , She was a widow , Widow ! Charmian , hark . And I do think she's thirty . Bear'st thou her face in mind ? is't long or round ? Round even to faultiness . For the most part , too , they are foolish that are so . Her hair , what colour ? Brown , madam ; and her forehead As low as she would wish it . There's gold for thee : Thou must not take my former sharpness ill . I will employ thee back again ; I find thee Most fit for business . Go , make thee ready ; Our letters are prepar'd . A proper man . Indeed , he is so ; I repent me much That so I harried him . Why , methinks , by him , This creature's no such thing . Nothing , madam . The man hath seen some majesty , and should know . Hath he seen majesty ? Isis else defend , And serving you so long ! I have one thing more to ask him yet , good Charmian : But 'tis no matter ; thou shalt bring him to me Where I will write . All may be well enough . I warrant you , madam . Nay , nay , Octavia , not only that , That were excusable , that , and thousands more Of semblable import , but he hath wag'd New wars 'gainst Pompey ; made his will , and read it To public ear : Spoke scantly of me ; when perforce he could not But pay me terms of honour , cold and sickly He vented them ; most narrow measure lent me ; When the best hint was given him , he not took 't , Or did it from his teeth . O my good lord ! Believe not all ; or , if you must believe , Stomach not all . A more unhappy lady , If this division chance , ne'er stood between , Praying for both parts : The good gods will mock me presently , When I shall pray , 'O ! bless my lord and husband ;' Undo that prayer , by crying out as loud , 'O ! bless my brother !' Husband win , win brother , Prays , and destroys the prayer ; no midway 'Twixt these extremes at all . Gentle Octavia , Let your best love draw to that point which seeks Best to preserve it . If I lose mine honour I lose myself ; better I were not yours Than yours so branchless . But , as you requested , Yourself shall go between's ; the mean time , lady , I'll raise the preparation of a war Shall stain your brother ; make your soonest haste , So your desires are yours . Thanks to my lord . The Jove of power make me most weak , most weak , Your reconciler ! Wars 'twixt you twain would be As if the world should cleave , and that slain men Should solder up the rift . When it appears to you where this begins , Turn your displeasure that way ; for our faults Can never be so equal that your love Can equally move with them . Provide your going ; Choose your own company , and command what cost Your heart has mind to . How now , friend Eros ! There's strange news come , sir . What , man ? C sar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey . This is old : what is the success ? C sar , having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey , presently denied him rivality , would not let him partake in the glory of the action ; and not resting here , accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey ; upon his own appeal , seizes him : so the poor third is up , till death enlarge his confine . Then , world , thou hast a pair of chaps , no more ; And throw between them all the food thou hast , They'll grind the one the other . Where's Antony ? He's walking in the garden thus : and spurns The rush that lies before him ; cries , 'Fool , Lepidus !' And threats the throat of that his officer That murder'd Pompey . Our great navy's rigg'd . For Italy and C sar . More , Domitius ; My lord desires you presently : my news I might have told hereafter . 'Twill be naught ; But let it be . Bring me to Antony . Come , sir . Contemning Rome , he has done all this and more In Alexandria ; here's the manner of 't ; I' the market-place , on a tribunal silver'd , Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthron'd ; at the feet sat C sarion , whom they call my father's son , And all the unlawful issue that their lust Since then hath made between them . Unto her He gave the 'stablishment of Egypt ; made her Of Lower Syria , Cyprus , Lydia , Absolute queen . This in the public eye ? I' the common show-place , where they exercise . His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings ; Great Media , Parthia , and Armenia He gave to Alexander ; to Ptolemy he assign'd Syria , Cilicia , and Ph nicia . She In the habiliments of the goddess Isis That day appear'd ; and oft before gave audience , As 'tis reported , so . Let Rome be thus Informed . Who , queasy with his insolence Already , will their good thoughts call from him . The people know it ; and have now receiv'd His accusations . Whom does he accuse ? C sar ; and that , having in Sicily Sextus Pompeius spoil'd , we had not rated him His part o' the isle ; then does he say , he lent me Some shipping unrestor'd ; lastly , he frets That Lepidus of the triumvirate Should be depos'd ; and , being , that we detain All his revenue . Sir , this should be answer'd . 'Tis done already , and the messenger gone . I have told him , Lepidus was grown too cruel ; That he his high authority abus'd , And did deserve his change : for what I have conquer'd , I grant him part ; but then , in his Armenia , And other of his conquer'd kingdoms , I Demand the like . He'll never yield to that . Nor must not then be yielded to in this . Hail , C sar , and my lord ! hail , most dear C sar ! That ever I should call thee cast-away ! You have not call'd me so , nor have you cause . Why have you stol'n upon us thus ? You come not Like C sar's sister ; the wife of Antony Should have an army for an usher , and The neighs of horse to tell of her approach Long ere she did appear ; the trees by the way Should have borne men ; and expectation fainted , Longing for what it had not ; nay , the dust Should have ascended to the roof of heaven , Rais'd by your populous troops . But you are come A market-maid to Rome , and have prevented The ostentation of our love , which , left unshown , Is often left unlov'd : we should have met you By sea and land , supplying every stage With an augmented greeting . Good my lord , To come thus was I not constrain'd , but did it On my free-will . My lord , Mark Antony , Hearing that you prepar'd for war , acquainted My grieved ear withal ; whereon , I begg'd His pardon for return . Which soon he granted , Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him . Do not say so , my lord . I have eyes upon him , And his affairs come to me on the wind . Where is he now ? My lord , in Athens . No , my most wrong'd sister ; Cleopatra Hath nodded him to her . He hath given his empire Up to a whore ; who now are levying The kings o' the earth for war . He hath assembled Bocchus , the King of Libya ; Archelaus , Of Cappadocia ; Philadelphos , King Of Paphlagonia ; the Thracian king , Adallas ; King Malchus of Arabia ; King of Pont ; Herod of Jewry ; Mithridates , King Of Comagene ; Polemon and Amintas , The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia , With a more larger list of sceptres . Ay me , most wretched , That have my heart parted betwixt two friends That do afflict each other ! Welcome hither : Your letters did withhold our breaking forth , Till we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led And we in negligent danger . Cheer your heart ; Be you not troubled with the time , which drives O'er your content these strong necessities , But let determin'd things to destiny Hold unbewail'd their way . Welcome to Rome ; Nothing more dear to me . You are abus'd Beyond the mark of thought , and the high gods , To do you justice , make their ministers Of us and those that love you . Best of comfort , And ever welcome to us . Welcome , lady . Welcome , dear madam . Each heart in Rome does love and pity you ; Only the adulterous Antony , most large In his abominations , turns you off , And gives his potent regiment to a trull , That noises it against us . Is it so , sir ? Most certain . Sister , welcome ; pray you , Be ever known to patience ; my dearest sister ! I will be even with thee , doubt it not . But why , why , why ? Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars , And sayst it is not fit . Well , is it , is it ? If not denounc'd against us , why should not we Be there in person ? Well , I could reply : If we should serve with horse and mares together , The horse were merely lost ; the mares would bear A soldier and his horse . What is 't you say ? Your presence needs must puzzle Antony ; Take from his heart , take from his brain , from 's time , What should not then be spar'd . He is already Traduc'd for levity , and 'tis said in Rome That Photinus a eunuch and your maids Manage this war . Sink Rome , and their tongues rot That speak against us ! A charge we bear i' the war , And , as the president of my kingdom , will Appear there for a man . Speak not against it ; I will not stay behind . Nay , I have done . Here comes the emperor . Is it not strange , Canidius , That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea , And take in Toryne ? You have heard on 't , sweet ? Celerity is never more admir'd Than by the negligent . A good rebuke , Which might have well becom'd the best of men , To taunt at slackness . Canidius , we Will fight with him by sea . By sea ! What else ? Why will my lord do so ? For that he dares us to 't . So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight . Ay , and to wage his battle at Pharsalia , Where C sar fought with Pompey ; but these offers , Which serve not for his vantage , he shakes off ; And so should you . Your ships are not well mann'd ; Your mariners are muleters , reapers , people Ingross'd by swift impress ; in C sar's fleet Are those that often have gainst Pompey fought : Their ships are yare ; yours , heavy . No disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea , Being prepar'd for land . By sea , by sea . Most worthy sir , you therein throw away The absolute soldiership you have by land ; Distract your army , which doth most consist Of war-mark'd footmen ; leave unexecuted Your own renowned knowledge ; quite forego The way which promises assurance ; and Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard From firm security . I'll fight at sea . I have sixty sails , C sar none better . Our overplus of shipping will we burn ; And with the rest , full-mann'd , from the head of Actium Beat the approaching C sar . But if we fail , We then can do 't at land . Thy business ? The news is true , my lord ; he is descried ; C sar has taken Toryne . Can he be there in person ? 'tis impossible ; Strange that his power should be . Canidius , Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land , And our twelve thousand horse . We'll to our ship : Away , my Thetis ! How now , worthy soldier ! O noble emperor ! do not fight by sea ; Trust not to rotten planks : do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds ? Let the Egyptians And the Ph nicians go a-ducking ; we Have used to conquer , standing on the earth , And fighting foot to foot . Well , well : away ! By Hercules , I think I am i' the right . Soldier , thou art ; but his whole action grows Not in the power on 't : so our leader's led , And we are women's men . You keep by land The legions and the horse whole , do you not ? Marcus Octavius , Marcus Justeius , Publicola , and C lius , are for sea ; But we keep whole by land . This speed of C sar's Carries beyond belief . While he was yet in Rome His power went out in such distractions as Beguil'd all spies . Who's his lieutenant , hear you ? They say , one Taurus . Well I know the man . The emperor calls Canidius . With news the time's with labour , and throes forth Each minute some . Taurus ! My lord ? Strike not by land ; keep whole : provoke not battle . Till we have done at sea . Do not exceed The prescript of this scroll : our fortune lies Upon this jump . Set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill , In eye of C sar's battle ; from which place We may the number of the ships behold , And so proceed accordingly . Naught , naught , all naught ! I can behold no longer . The Antoniad , the Egyptian admiral , With all their sixty , fly , and turn the rudder ; To see 't mine eyes are blasted . Gods and goddesses , All the whole synod of them ! What's thy passion ? The greater cantle of the world is lost With very ignorance ; we have kiss'd away Kingdoms and provinces . How appears the fight ? On our side like the token'd pestilence , Where death is sure . Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt , Whom leprosy o'ertake ! i' the midst o' the fight , When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd , Both as the same , or rather ours the elder , The breese upon her , like a cow in June , Hoists sails and flies . That I beheld : Mine eyes did sicken at the sight , and could not Endure a further view . She once being loof'd , The noble ruin of her magic , Antony , Clapson his sea-wing , and like a doting mallard , Leaving the fight in height , flies after her . I never saw an action of such shame ; Experience , manhood , honour , ne'er before Did violate so itself . Alack , alack ! Our fortune on the sea is out of breath , And sinks most lamentably . Had our general Been what he knew himself , it had gone well : O ! he has given example for our flight Most grossly by his own . Ay , are you thereabouts ? Why , then , good night , indeed . Towards Peloponnesus are they fled . 'Tis easy to 't ; and there I will attend What further comes . To C sar will I render My legions and my horse ; six kings already Show me the way of yielding . I'll yet follow The wounded chance of Antony , though my reason Sits in the wind against me . Hark ! the land bids me tread no more upon 't ; It is asham'd to bear me . Friends , come hither : I am so lated in the world that I Have lost my way for ever . I have a ship Laden with gold ; take that , divide it ; fly , And make your peace with C sar . Fly ! not we . I have fled myself , and have instructed cowards To run and show their shoulders . Friends , be gone ; I have myself resolv'd upon a course Which has no need of you ; be gone : My treasure's in the harbour , take it . O ! I follow'd that I blush to look upon : My very hairs do mutiny , for the white Reprove the brown for rashness , and they them For fear and doting . Friends , be gone ; you shall Have letters from me to some friends that will Sweep your way for you . Pray you , look not sad , Nor make replies of loathness ; take the hint Which my despair proclaims ; let that be left Which leaves itself ; to the sea-side straightway ; I will possess you of that ship and treasure . Leave me , I pray , a little ; pray you now : Nay , do so ; for , indeed , I have lost command , Therefore I pray you . I'll see you by and by . Nay , gentle madam , to him , comfort him . Do , most dear queen . Do ! Why , what else ? Let me sit down . O Juno ! No , no , no , no , no . See you here , sir ? O fie , fie , fie ! Madam ! Madam ; O good empress ! Sir , sir ! Yes , my lord , yes . He , at Philippi kept His sword e'en like a dancer , while I struck The lean and wrinkled Cassius ; and 'twas I That the mad Brutus ended : he alone Dealt on lieutenantry , and no practice had In the brave squares of war : yet now No matter . Ah ! stand by . The queen , my lord , the queen . Go to him , madam , speak to him ; He is unqualitied with very shame . Well then , sustain me : O ! Most noble sir , arise ; the queen approaches : Her head's declin'd , and death will seize her , but Your comfort makes the rescue . I have offended reputation , A most unnoble swerving . Sir , the queen . O ! whither hast thou led me , Egypt ? See , How I convey my shame out of thine eyes By looking back what I have left behind 'Stroy'd in dishonour . O my lord , my lord ! Forgive my fearful sails : I little thought You would have follow'd . Egypt , thou knew'st too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings , And thou shouldst tow me after ; o'er my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knew'st , and that Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me . O ! my pardon . Now I must To the young man send humble treaties , dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness , who With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleas'd , Making and marring fortunes . You did know How much you were my conqueror , and that My sword , made weak by my affection , would Obey it on all cause . Pardon , pardon ! Fall not a tear , I say ; one of them rates All that is won and lost . Give me a kiss ; Even this repays me . We sent our schoolmaster ; Is he come back ? Love , I am full of lead . Some wine , within there , and our viands ! Fortune knows , We scorn her most when most she offers blows . Let him appear that's come from Antony . Know you him ? C sar , 'tis his schoolmaster : An argument that he is pluck'd , when hither He sends so poor a pinion of his wing , Which had superfluous kings for messengers Not many moons gone by . Approach , and speak . Such as I am , I come from Antony : I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf To his grand sea . Be 't so . Declare thine office . Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee , and Requires to live in Egypt ; which not granted , He lessens his requests , and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth , A private man in Athens ; this for him . Next , Cleopatra does confess thy greatness , Submits her to thy might , and of thee craves The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs , Now hazarded to thy grace . For Antony , I have no ears to his request . The queen Of audience nor desire shall fail , so she From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend , Or take his life there ; this if she perform , She shall not sue unheard . So to them both . Fortune pursue thee ! Bring him through the bands . From Antony win Cleopatra ; promise , And in our name , what she requires ; add more , From thine invention , offers . Women are not In their best fortunes strong , but want will perjure The ne'er-touch'd vestal . Try thy cunning , Thyreus ; Make thine own edict for thy pains , which we Will answer as a law . C sar , I go . Observe how Antony becomes his flaw , And what thou think'st his very action speaks In every power that moves . C sar , I shall . What shall we do , Enobarbus ? Think , and die . Is Antony or we , in fault for this ? Antony only , that would make his will Lord of his reason . What though you fled From that great face of war , whose several ranges Frighted each other , why should he follow ? The itch of his affection should not then Have nick'd his captainship ; at such a point , When half to half the world oppos'd , he being The mered question . 'Twas a shame no less Than was his loss , to course your flying flags , And leave his navy gazing . Prithee , peace . Is that his answer ? Ay , my lord . The queen shall then have courtesy , so she Will yield us up ? He says so . Let her know't . To the boy C sar send this grizzled head , And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities . That head , my lord ? To him again . Tell him he wears the rose Of youth upon him , from which the world should note Something particular ; his coin , ships , legions , May be a coward's , whose ministers would prevail Under the service of a child as soon As i' the command of C sar : I dare him therefore To lay his gay comparisons apart , And answer me declin'd , sword against sword , Ourselves alone . I'll write it : follow me . Yes , like enough , high-battled C sar will Unstate his happiness , and be stag'd to the show Against a sworder ! I see men's judgments are A parcel of their fortunes , and things outward Do draw the inward quality after them , To suffer all alike . That he should dream , Knowing all measures , the full C sar will Answer his emptiness ! C sar , thou hast subdu'd His judgment too . A messenger from C sar . What ! no more ceremony ? See ! my women ; Against the blown rose may they stop their nose , That kneel'd unto the buds . Admit him , sir . Mine honesty and I begin to square . The loyalty well held to fools does make Our faith mere folly ; yet he that can endure To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord , Does conquer him that did his master conquer , And earns a place i' the story . C sar's will ? Hear it apart . None but friends ; say boldly . So , haply , are they friends to Antony . He needs as many , sir , as C sar has , Or needs not us . If C sar please , our master Will leap to be his friend ; for us , you know Whose he is we are , and that is C sar's . So . Thus then , thou most renown'd : C sar entreats , Not to consider in what case thou stand'st , Further than he is C sar . Go on ; right royal . He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love , but as you fear'd him .
