In delivering my son from me , I bury a second husband . And I , in going , madam , weep o'er my father's death anew ; but I must attend his majesty's command , to whom I am now in ward , evermore in subjection . You shall find of the king a husband , madam ; you , sir , a father . He that so generally is at all times good , must of necessity hold his virtue to you , whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance . What hope is there of his majesty's amendment ? He hath abandoned his physicians , madam ; under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope , and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time . This young gentlewoman had a father ,O , that 'had !' how sad a passage 'tis !whose skill was almost as great as his honesty ; had it stretched so far , would have made nature immortal , and death should have play for lack of work . Would , for the king's sake , he were living ! I think it would be the death of the king's disease . How called you the man you speak of , madam ? He was famous , sir , in his profession , and it was his great right to be so : Gerard de Narbon . He was excellent indeed , madam : the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly . He was skilful enough to have lived still , if knowledge could be set up against mortality . What is it , my good lord , the king languishes of ? A fistula , my lord . I heard not of it before . I would it were not notorious . Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon ? His sole child , my lord ; and bequeathed to my overlooking . I have those hopes of her good that her education promises : her dispositions she inherits , which makes fair gifts fairer ; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities , there commendations go with pity ; they are virtues and traitors too : in her they are the better for their simpleness ; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness . Your commendations , madam , get from her tears . 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in . The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek . No more of this , Helena , go to , no more ; lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow , than have it . I do affect a sorrow indeed , but I have it too . Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead , excessive grief the enemy to the living . If the living be enemy to the grief , the excess makes it soon mortal . Madam , I desire your holy wishes . How understand we that ? Be thou blest , Bertram ; and succeed thy father In manners , as in shape ! thy blood and virtue Contend for empire in thee ; and thy goodness Share with thy birthright ! Love all , trust a few , Do wrong to none : be able for thine enemy Rather in power than use , and keep thy friend Under thy own life's key : be check'd for silence , But never tax'd for speech . What heaven more will That thee may furnish , and my prayers pluck down , Fall on thy head ! Farewell , my lord ; 'Tis an unseason'd courtier ; good my lord , Advise him . He cannot want the best That shall attend his love . Heaven bless him ! Farewell , Bertram . The best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you ! Be comfortable to my mother , your mistress , and make much of her . Farewell , pretty lady : you must hold the credit of your father . O ! were that all . I think not on my father ; And these great tears grace his remembrance more Than those I shed for him . What was he like ? I have forgot him : my imagination Carries no favour in't but Bertram's . I am undone : there is no living , none , If Bertram be away . It were all one That I should love a bright particular star And think to wed it , he is so above me : In his bright radiance and collateral light Must I be comforted , not in his sphere . The ambition in my love thus plagues itself : The hind that would be mated by the lion Must die for love . 'Twas pretty , though a plague , To see him every hour ; to sit and draw His arched brows , his hawking eye , his curls , In our heart's table ; heart too capable Of every line and trick of his sweet favour : But now he's gone , and my idolatrous fancy Must sanctify his reliques . Who comes here ? One that goes with him : I love him for his sake ; And yet I know him a notorious liar , Think him a great way fool , solely a coward ; Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him , That they take place , when virtue's steely bones Look bleak in the cold wind : withal , full oft we see Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly . Save you , fair queen ! And you , monarch ! No . And no . Are you meditating on virginity ? Ay . You have some stain of soldier in you ; let me ask you a question . Man is enemy to virginity ; how may we barricado it against him ? Keep him out . But he assails ; and our virginity , though valiant in the defence , yet is weak . Unfold to us some war-like resistance . There is none : man , sitting down before you , will undermine you and blow you up . Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up ! Is there no military policy , how virgins might blow up men ? Virginity being blown down , man will quicklier be blown up : marry in blowing him down again , with the breach yourselves made , you lose your city . It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity . Loss of virginity is rational increase , and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost . That you were made of is metal to make virgins . Virginity , by being once lost , may be ten times found : by being ever kept , it is ever lost .'Tis too cold a companion : away with't ! I will stand for't a little , though therefore I die a virgin . There's little can be said in't ; 'tis against the rule of nature . To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers , which is most infallible disobedience . He that hangs himself is a virgin : virginity murders itself , and should be buried in highways , out of all sanctified limit , as a desperate offendress against nature . Virginity breeds mites , much like a cheese , consumes itself to the very paring , and so dies with feeding his own stomach . Besides , virginity is peevish , proud , idle , made of self-love , which is the most inhibited sin in the canon . Keep it not ; you cannot choose but lose by't ! Out with't ! within the year it will make itself two , which is a goodly increase , and the principal itself not much the worse . Away with't ! How might one do , sir , to lose it to her own liking ? Let me see : marry , ill , to like him that ne'er it likes . 'Tis a commodity that will lose the gloss with lying ; the longer kept , the less worth : off with't , while 'tis vendible ; answer the time of request . Virginity , like an old courtier , wears her cap out of fashion ; richly suited , but unsuitable : just like the brooch and the toothpick , which wear not now . Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek : and your virginity , your old virginity , is like one of our French withered pears ; it looks ill , it eats drily ; marry , 'tis a withered pear ; it was formerly better ; marry , yet 'tis a withered pear . Will you anything with it ? Not my virginity yet . There shall your master have a thousand loves , A mother , and a mistress , and a friend , A ph nix , captain , and an enemy , A guide , a goddess , and a sovereign , A counsellor , a traitress , and a dear ; His humble ambition , proud humility , His jarring concord , and his discord dulcet , His faith , his sweet disaster ; with a world Of pretty , fond , adoptious christendoms , That blinking Cupid gossips . Now shall he I know not what he shall . God send him well ! The court's a learning-place , and he is one What one , i' faith ? That I wish well . 'Tis pity What's pity ? That wishing well had not a body in't , Which might be felt ; that we , the poorer born , Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes , Might with effects of them follow our friends , And show what we alone must think , which never Returns us thanks . Monsieur Parolles , my lord calls for you . Little Helen , farewell : if I can remember thee , I will think of thee at court . Monsieur Parolles , you were born under a charitable star . Under Mars , I . I especially think , under Mars . Why under Mars ? The wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars . When he was predominant . When he was retrograde , I think rather . Why think you so ? You go so much backward when you fight . That's for advantage . So is running away , when fear proposes the safety : but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing , and I like the wear well . I am so full of businesses I cannot answer thee acutely . I will return perfect courtier ; in the which , my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee , so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's counsel , and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee ; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness , and thine ignorance makes thee away : farewell . When thou hast leisure , say thy prayers ; when thou hast none , remember thy friends . Get thee a good husband , and use him as he uses thee : so , farewell . Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie Which we ascribe to heaven : the fated sky Gives us free scope ; only doth backward pull Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull . What power is it which mounts my love so high ; That makes me see , and cannot feed mine eye ? The mightiest space in fortune nature brings To join like likes , and kiss like native things . Impossible be strange attempts to those That weigh their pains in sense , and do suppose What hath been cannot be : who ever strove To show her merit , that did miss her love ? The king's disease ,my project may deceive me , But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me . The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears ; Have fought with equal fortune , and continue A braving war . So 'tis reported , sir . Nay , 'tis most credible : we here receive it A certainty , vouch'd from our cousin Austria , With caution that the Florentine will move us For speedy aid ; wherein our dearest friend Prejudicates the business , and would seem To have us make denial . His love and wisdom , Approv'd so to your majesty , may plead For amplest credence . He hath arm'd our answer , And Florence is denied before he comes : Yet , for our gentlemen that mean to see The Tuscan service , freely have they leave To stand on either part . It well may serve A nursery to our gentry , who are sick For breathing and exploit . What's he comes here ? It is the Count Rousillon , my good lord , Young Betram . Youth , thou bear'st thy father's face ; Frank nature , rather curious than in haste , Hath well compos'd thee . Thy father's moral parts Mayst thou inherit too ! Welcome to Paris . My thanks and duty are your majesty's . I would I had that corporal soundness now , As when thy father and myself in friendship First tried our soldiership ! He did look far Into the service of the time and was Discipled of the bravest : he lasted long ; But on us both did haggish age steal on , And wore us out of act . It much repairs me To talk of your good father . In his youth He had the wit which I can well observe To-day in our young lords ; but they may jest Till their own scorn return to them unnoted Ere they can hide their levity in honour . So like a courtier , contempt nor bitterness Were in his pride or sharpness ; if they were , His equal had awak'd them ; and his honour , Clock to itself , knew the true minute when Exception bid him speak , and at this time His tongue obey'd his hand : who were below him He us'd as creatures of another place , And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks , Making them proud of his humility , In their poor praise he humbled . Such a man Might be a copy to these younger times , Which , follow'd well , would demonstrate them now But goers backward . His good remembrance , sir , Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb ; So in approof lives not his epitaph As in your royal speech . Would I were with him ! He would always say , Methinks I hear him now : his plausive words He scatter'd not in ears , but grafted them , To grow there and to bear . 'Let me not live ,' Thus his good melancholy oft began , On the catastrophe and heel of pastime , When it was out ,'Let me not live ,' quoth he , 'After my flame lacks oil , to be the snuff Of younger spirits , whose apprehensive senses All but new things disdain ; whose judgments are Mere fathers of their garments ; whose constancies Expire before their fashions .' This he wish'd : I , after him , do after him wish too , Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home , I quickly were dissolved from my hive , To give some labourers room . You are lov'd , sir ; They that least lend it you shall lack you first . I fill a place , I know't . How long is't , count , Since the physician at your father's died ? He was much fam'd . Some six months since , my lord . If he were living , I would try him yet : Lend me an arm : the rest have worn me out With several applications : nature and sickness Debate it at their leisure . Welcome , count ; My son's no dearer . Thank your majesty . I will now hear : what say you of this gentlewoman ? Madam , the care I have had to even your content , I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours ; for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings , when of ourselves we publish them . What does this knave here ? Get you gone , sirrah : the complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe : 'tis my slowness that I do not ; for I know you lack not folly to commit them , and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours . 'Tis not unknown to you , madam , I am a poor fellow . Well , sir . No , madam , 'tis not so well that I am poor , though many of the rich are damned . But , if I may have your ladyship's good will to go to the world , Isbel the woman and I will do as we may . Wilt thou needs be a beggar ? I do beg your good will in this case . In what case ? In Isbel's case and mine own . Service is no heritage ; and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o' my body , for they say barnes are blessings . Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry . My poor body , madam , requires it : I am driven on by the flesh ; and he must needs go that the devil drives . Is this all your worship's reason ? Faith , madam , I have other holy reasons , such as they are . May the world know them ? I have been , madam , a wicked creature , as you and all flesh and blood are ; and , indeed , I do marry that I may repent . Thy marriage , sooner than thy wickedness . I am out o' friends , madam ; and I hope to have friends for my wife's sake . Such friends are thine enemies , knave . You're shallow , madam , in great friends ; for the knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of . He that ears my land spares my team , and gives me leave to in the crop : if I be his cuckold , he's my drudge . He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood ; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood ; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend : ergo , he that kisses my wife is my friend . If men could be contented to be what they are , there were no fear in marriage ; for young Charbon the puritan , and old Poysam the papist , howsome'er their hearts are severed in religion , their heads are both one ; they may joul horns together like any deer i' the herd . Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave ? A prophet I , madam ; and I speak the truth the next way : For I the ballad will repeat , Which men full true shall find ; Your marriage comes by destiny , Your cuckoo sings by kind . Get you gone , sir : I'll talk with you more anon . May it please you , madam , that he bid Helen come to you : of her I am to speak . Sirrah , tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her ; Helen I mean . Was this fair face the cause , quoth she , Why the Grecians sacked Troy ? Fond done , done fond , Was this King Priam's joy ? With that she sighed as she stood , With that she sighed as she stood , And gave this sentence then ; Among nine bad if one be good , Among nine bad if one be good , There's yet one good in ten . What ! one good in ten ? you corrupt the song , sirrah . One good woman in ten , madam ; which is a purifying o' the song . Would God would serve the world so all the year ! we'd find no fault with the tithe-woman if I were the parson . One in ten , quoth a' ! An we might have a good woman born but for every blazing star , or at an earthquake ,'twould mend the lottery well : a man may draw his heart out ere a' pluck one . You'll be gone , sir knave , and do as I command you ! That man should be at woman's command , and yet no hurt done ! Though honesty be no puritan , yet it will do no hurt ; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart . I am going , forsooth : the business is for Helen to come hither . Well , now . I know , madam , you love your gentlewoman entirely . Faith , I do : her father bequeathed her to me ; and she herself , without other advantage , may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds : there is more owing her than is paid , and more shall be paid her than she'll demand . Madam , I was very late more near her than I think she wished me : alone she was , and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears ; she thought , I dare vow for her , they touched not any stranger sense . Her matter was , she loved your son : Fortune , she said , was no goddess , that had put such difference betwixt their two estates ; Love no god , that would not extend his might , only where qualities were level ; Dian no queen of virgins , that would suffer her poor knight surprised , without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward . This she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in ; which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal , sithence in the loss that may happen , it concerns you something to know it . You have discharged this honestly : keep it to yourself . Many likelihoods informed me of this before , which hung so tottering in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt . Pray you , leave me : stall this in your bosom ; and I thank you for your honest care . I will speak with you further anon . Even so it was with me when I was young : If ever we are nature's , these are ours ; this thorn Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong ; Our blood to us , this to our blood is born : It is the show and seal of nature's truth , Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth : By our remembrances of days foregone , Such were our faults ; or then we thought them none . Her eye is sick on't : I observe her now . What is your pleasure , madam ? You know , Helen , I am a mother to you . Mine honourable mistress . Nay , a mother : Why not a mother ? When I said , 'a mother ,' Methought you saw a serpent : what's in 'mother' That you start at it ? I say , I am your mother ; And put you in the catalogue of those That were enwombed mine : 'tis often seen Adoption strives with nature , and choice breeds A native slip to us from foreign seeds ; You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan , Yet I express to you a mother's care . God's mercy , maiden ! does it curd thy blood To say I am thy mother ? What's the matter , That this distemper'd messenger of wet , The many-colour'd Iris , rounds thine eye ? Why ? that you are my daughter ? That I am not . I say , I am your mother . Pardon , madam ; The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother : I am from humble , he from honour'd name ; No note upon my parents , his all noble : My master , my dear lord he is ; and I His servant live , and will his vassal die . He must not be my brother . Nor I your mother ? You are my mother , madam : would you were , So that my lord your son were not my brother , Indeed my mother ! or were you both our mothers , I care no more for than I do for heaven , So I were not his sister . Can't no other , But , I your daughter , he must be my brother ? Yes , Helen , you might be my daughter-in-law : God shield you mean it not ! daughter and mother So strive upon your pulse . What , pale again ? My fear hath catch'd your fondness : now I see The mystery of your loneliness , and find Your salt tears' head : now to all sense 'tis gross You love my son : invention is asham'd , Against the proclamation of thy passion , To say thou dost not : therefore tell me true ; But tell me then , 'tis so ; for , look , thy cheeks Confess it , th' one to th' other ; and thine eyes See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours That in their kind they speak it : only sin And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue , That truth should be suspected . Speak , is't so ? If it be so , you have wound a goodly clew ; If it be not , forswear't : howe'er , I charge thee , As heaven shall work in me for thine avail , To tell me truly . Good madam , pardon me ! Do you love my son ? Your pardon , noble mistress ! Love you my son ? Do not you love him , madam ? Go not about ; my love hath in't a bond Whereof the world takes note : come , come , disclose The state of your affection , for your passions Have to the full appeach'd . Then , I confess , Here on my knee , before high heaven and you That before you , and next unto high heaven , I love your son . My friends were poor , but honest ; so's my love : Be not offended , for it hurts not him That he is lov'd of me : I follow him not By any token of presumptuous suit ; Nor would I have him till I do deserve him ; Yet never know how that desert should be . I know I love in vain , strive against hope ; Yet , in this captious and intenible sieve I still pour in the waters of my love , And lack not to lose still . Thus , Indian-like , Religious in mine error , I adore The sun , that looks upon his worshipper , But knows of him no more . My dearest madam , Let not your hate encounter with my love For loving where you do : but , if yourself , Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth , Did ever in so true a flame of liking Wish chastely and love dearly , that your Dian Was both herself and Love ; O ! then , give pity To her , whose state is such that cannot choose But lend and give where she is sure to lose ; That seeks not to find that her search implies , But , riddle-like , lives sweetly where she dies . Had you not lately an intent , speak truly , To go to Paris ? Madam , I had . Wherefore ? tell true . I will tell truth ; by grace itself I swear . You know my father left me some prescriptions Of rare and prov'd effects , such as his reading And manifest experience had collected For general sovereignty ; and that he will'd me In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them , As notes whose faculties inclusive were More than they were in note . Amongst the rest , There is a remedy , approv'd , set down To cure the desperate languishings whereof The king is render'd lost . This was your motive For Paris , was it ? speak . My lord your son made me to think of this ; Else Paris , and the medicine , and the king , Had from the conversation of my thoughts Haply been absent then . But think you , Helen , If you should tender your supposed aid , He would receive it ? He and his physicians Are of a mind ; he , that they cannot help him , They , that they cannot help . How shall they credit A poor unlearned virgin , when the schools , Embowell'd of their doctrine , have left off The danger to itself ? There's something in't , More than my father's skill , which was the great'st Of his profession , that his good receipt Shall for my legacy be sanctified By the luckiest stars in heaven : and , would your honour But give me leave to try success , I'd venture The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure , By such a day , and hour . Dost thou believe't ? Ay , madam , knowingly . Why , Helen , thou shalt have my leave and love , Means , and attendants , and my loving greetings To those of mine in court . I'll stay at home And pray God's blessing into thy attempt . Be gone to-morrow ; and be sure of this , What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss . Farewell , young lords : these war-like principles Do not throw from you : and you , my lords , farewell : Share the advice betwixt you ; if both gain , all The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis receiv'd , And is enough for both . 'Tis our hope , sir , After well enter'd soldiers , to return And find your Grace in health . No , no , it cannot be ; and yet my heart Will not confess he owes the malady That doth my life besiege . Farewell , young lords ; Whether I live or die , be you the sons Of worthy Frenchmen : let higher Italy Those bated that inherit but the fall Of the last monarchy see that you come Not to woo honour , but to wed it ; when The bravest questant shrinks , find what you seek That fame may cry you loud : I say , farewell . Health , at your bidding , serve your majesty ! Those girls of Italy , take heed of them : They say , our French lack language to deny If they demand : beware of being captives , Before you serve . Our hearts receive your warnings . Farewell . Come hither to me . O my sweet lord , that you will stay behind us ! 'Tis not his fault , the spark . O ! 'tis brave wars . Most admirable : I have seen those wars . I am commanded here , and kept a coil with 'Too young ,' and 'the next year ,' and ''tis too early .' An thy mind stand to't , boy , steal away bravely . I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock , Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry , Till honour be bought up and no sword worn But one to dance with ! By heaven ! I'll steal away . There's honour in the theft . Commit it , count . I am your accessary ; and so farewell . I grow to you , and our parting is a tortured body . Farewell , captain . Sweet Monsieur Parolles ! Noble heroes , my sword and yours are kin . Good sparks and lustrous , a word , good metals : you shall find in the regiment of the Spinii , one Captain Spurio , with his cicatrice , an emblem of war , here on his sinister cheek : it was this very sword entrenched it : say to him , I live , and observe his reports for me We shall , noble captain . Mars dote on you for his novices ! What will ye do ? Stay ; the king . Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords ; you have restrained yourself within the list of too cold an adieu : be more expressive to them ; for they wear themselves in the cap of the time , there do muster true gait , eat , speak , and move under the influence of the most received star ; and though the devil lead the measure , such are to be followed . After them , and take a more dilated farewell . And I will do so . Worthy fellows ; and like to prove most sinewy swordmen . Pardon , my lord , for me and for my tidings . I'll fee thee to stand up . Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon . I would you had kneel'd , my lord , to ask me mercy , And that at my bidding you could so stand up . I would I had ; so I had broke thy pate , And ask'd thee mercy for't . Good faith , across : but , my good lord , 'tis thus ; Will you be cur'd of your infirmity ? No . O ! will you eat no grapes , my royal fox ? Yes , but you will my noble grapes an if My royal fox could reach them . I have seen a medicine That's able to breathe life into a stone , Quicken a rock , and make you dance canary With spritely fire and motion ; whose simple touch Is powerful to araise King Pepin , nay , To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand And write to her a love-line . What 'her' is this ? Why , Doctor She . My lord , there's one arriv'd If you will see her : now , by my faith and honour , If seriously I may convey my thoughts In this my light deliverance , I have spoke With one , that in her sex , her years , profession , Wisdom , and constancy , hath amaz'd me more Than I dare blame my weakness . Will you see her , For that is her demand , and know her business ? That done , laugh well at me . Now , good Lafeu , Bring in the admiration , that we with thee May spend our wonder too , or take off thine By wond'ring how thou took'st it . Nay , I'll fit you , And not be all day neither . Thus he his special nothing ever prologues . Nay , come your ways . This haste hath wings indeed . Nay , come your ways ; This is his majesty , say your mind to him : A traitor you do look like ; but such traitors His majesty seldom fears : I am Cressid's uncle , That dare leave two together . Fare you well . Now , fair one , does your business follow us ? Ay , my good lord . Gerard de Narbon was my father ; In what he did profess well found . I knew him . The rather will I spare my praises towards him ; Knowing him is enough . On's bed of death Many receipts he gave me ; chiefly one , Which , as the dearest issue of his practice , And of his old experience the only darling , He bade me store up as a triple eye , Safer than mine own two , more dear . I have so ; And , hearing your high majesty is touch'd With that malignant cause wherein the honour Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power , I come to tender it and my appliance , With all bound humbleness . We thank you , maiden ; But may not be so credulous of cure , When our most learned doctors leave us , and The congregated college have concluded That labouring art can never ransom nature From her inaidable estate ; I say we must not So stain our judgment , or corrupt our hope , To prostitute our past-cure malady To empirics , or to dissever so Our great self and our credit , to esteem A senseless help when help past sense we deem . My duty then , shall pay me for my pains : I will no more enforce mine office on you ; Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts A modest one , to bear me back again . I cannot give thee less , to be call'd grateful . Thou thought'st to help me , and such thanks I give As one near death to those that wish him live ; But what at full I know , thou know'st no part , I knowing all my peril , thou no art . What I can do can do no hurt to try , Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy . He that of greatest works is finisher Oft does them by the weakest minister : So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown , When judges have been babes ; great floods have flown From simple sources ; and great seas have dried When miracles have by the greatest been denied . Oft expectation fails , and most oft there Where most it promises ; and oft it hits Where hope is coldest and despair most fits . I must not hear thee : fare thee well , kind maid . Thy pains , not us'd , must by thyself be paid : Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward . Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd . It is not so with Him that all things knows , As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows ; But most it is presumption in us when The help of heaven we count the act of men . Dear sir , to my endeavours give consent ; Of heaven , not me , make an experiment . I am not an impostor that proclaim Myself against the level of mine aim ; But know I think , and think I know most sure , My art is not past power nor you past cure . Art thou so confident ? Within what space Hop'st thou my cure ? The great'st grace lending grace , Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring , Ere twice in murk and occidental damp Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp , Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass , What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly , Health shall live free , and sickness freely die . Upon thy certainty and confidence What dar'st thou venture ? Tax of impudence , A strumpet's boldness , a divulged shame , Traduc'd by odious ballads : my maiden's name Sear'd otherwise ; nay worse if worse extended With vilest torture let my life be ended . Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak , His powerful sound within an organ weak ; And what impossibility would slay In common sense , sense saves another way . Thy life is dear ; for all that life can rate Worth name of life in thee hath estimate ; Youth , beauty , wisdom , courage , virtue , all That happiness and prime can happy call : Thou this to hazard needs must intimate Skill infinite or monstrous desperate . Sweet practiser , thy physic I will try , That ministers thine own death if I die . If I break time , or flinch in property Of what I spoke , unpitied let me die , And well deserv'd . Not helping , death's my fee ; But , if I help , what do you promise me ? Make thy demand . But will you make it even ? Ay , by my sceptre , and my hopes of heaven . Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand What husband in thy power I will command : Exempted be from me the arrogance To choose from forth the royal blood of France , My low and humble name to propagate With any branch or image of thy state ; But such a one , thy vassal , whom I know Is free for me to ask , thee to bestow . Here is my hand ; the premises observ'd , Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd : So make the choice of thy own time , for I , Thy resolv'd patient , on thee still rely . More should I question thee , and more I must , Though more to know could not be more to trust , From whence thou cam'st , how tended on ; but rest Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest . Give me some help here , ho ! If thou proceed As high as word , my deed shall match thy deed . Come on , sir ; I shall now put you to the height of your breeding . I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught . I know my business is but to the court . To the court ! why what place make you special , when you put off that with such contempt ? 'But to the court !' Truly , madam , if God have lent a man any manners , he may easily put it off at court : he that cannot make a leg , put off's cap , kiss his hand , and say nothing , has neither leg , hands , lip , nor cap ; and indeed such a fellow , to say precisely , were not for the court . But , for me , I have an answer will serve all men . Marry , that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions . It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks ; the pin-buttock , the quatch-buttock , the brawn-buttock , or any buttock . Will your answer serve fit to all questions ? As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney , as your French crown for your taffeta punk , as Tib's rush for Tom's forefinger , as a pancake for Shrove-Tuesday , a morris for Mayday , as the nail to his hole , the cuckold to his horn , as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave , as the nun's lip to the friar's mouth ; nay , as the pudding to his skin . Have you , I say , an answer of such fitness for all questions ? From below your duke to beneath your constable , it will fit any question . It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands . But a trifle neither , in good faith , if the learned should speak truth of it . Here it is , and all that belongs to't : ask me if I am a courtier ; it shall do you no harm to learn . To be young again , if we could . I will be a fool in question , hoping to be the wiser by your answer . I pray you , sir , are you a courtier ? O Lord , sir ! there's a simple putting off . More , more , a hundred of them . Sir , I am a poor friend of yours , that loves you . O Lord , sir ! Thick , thick , spare not me . I think , sir , you can eat none of this homely meat . O Lord , sir ! Nay , put me to't , I warrant you . You were lately whipped , sir , as I think . O Lord , sir ! Spare not me . Do you cry , 'O Lord , sir !' at your whipping , and 'Spare not me ?' Indeed your 'O Lord , sir !' is very sequent to your whipping : you would answer very well to a whipping , if you were but bound to't . I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord , sir !' I see things may serve long , but not serve ever . I play the noble housewife with the time , To entertain't so merrily with a fool . O Lord , sir ! why , there't serves well again . An end , sir : to your business . Give Helen this , And urge her to a present answer back : Commend me to my kinsmen and my son . This is not much . Not much commendation to them . Not much employment for you : you understand me ? Most fruitfully : I am there before my legs . Haste you again . They say miracles are past ; and we have our philosophical persons , to make modern and familiar , things supernatural and causeless . Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors , ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge , when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear . Why , 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times . And so 'tis . To be relinquished of the artists , So I say . Both of Galen and Paracelsus . So I say . Of all the learned and authentic fellows , Right ; so I say . That gave him out incurable , Why , there 'tis ; so say I too . Not to be helped , Right ; as 'twere , a man assured of a Uncertain life , and sure death . Just , you say well : so would I have said . I may truly say it is a novelty to the world . It is , indeed : if you will have it in showing , you shall read it in what do you call there A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor . That's it I would have said ; the very same . Why , your dolphin is not lustier : 'fore me , I speak in respect Nay , 'tis strange , 'tis very strange , that is the brief and the tedious of it ; and he is of a most facinorous spirit , that will not acknowledge it to be the Very hand of heaven Ay , so I say . In a most weak and debile minister , great power , great transcendence : which should , indeed , give us a further use to be made than alone the recovery of the king , as to be generally thankful . I would have said it ; you say well . Here comes the king . Lustig , as the Dutchman says : I'll like a maid the better , whilst I have a tooth in my head . Why , he's able to lead her a coranto . Mort du vinaigre ! Is not this Helen ? 'Fore God , I think so . Go , call before me all the lords in court . Sit , my preserver , by thy patient's side : And with this healthful hand , whose banish'd sense Thou hast repeal'd , a second time receive The confirmation of my promised gift , Which but attends thy naming . Fair maid , send forth thine eye : this youthful parcel Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing , O'er whom both sov'reign power and father's voice I have to use : thy frank election make ; Thou hast power to choose , and they none to forsake . To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress Fall , when Love please ! marry , to each , but one . I'd give bay Curtal , and his furniture , My mouth no more were broken than these boys' And writ as little beard . Peruse them well : Not one of those but had a noble father . Gentlemen , Heaven hath through me restor'd the king to health . We understand it , and thank heaven for you . I am a simple maid ; and therein wealthiest That I protest I simply am a maid . Please it your majesty , I have done already : The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me , 'We blush , that thou shouldst choose ; but , be refus'd , Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever ; We'll ne'er come there again .' Make choice ; and see , Who shuns thy love , shuns all his love in me . Now , Dian , from thy altar do I fly , And to imperial Love , that god most high , Do my sighs stream . Sir , will you hear my suit ? And grant it . Thanks , sir ; all the rest is mute . I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life . The honour , sir , that flames in your fair eyes , Before I speak , too threateningly replies : Love make your fortunes twenty times above Her that so wishes , and her humble love ! No better , if you please . My wish receive , Which great Love grant ! and so I take my leave . Do all they deny her ? An they were sons of mine , I'd have them whipp'd or I would send them to the Turk to make eunuchs of . Be not afraid that I your hand should take ; I'll never do you wrong for your own sake : Blessing upon your vows ! and in your bed Find fairer fortune , if you ever wed ! These boys are boys of ice , they'll none have her : sure , they are bastards to the English ; the French ne'er got 'em . You are too young , too happy , and too good , To make yourself a son out of my blood . Fair one , I think not so . There's one grape yet . I am sure thy father drunk wine . But if thou be'st not an ass , I am a youth of fourteen : I have known thee already . I dare not say I take you ; but I give Me and my service , ever whilst I live , Into your guiding power . This is the man . Why then , young Bertram , take her ; she's thy wife . My wife , my liege ! I shall beseech your highness In such a business give me leave to use The help of mine own eyes . Know'st thou not , Bertram , What she has done for me ? Yes , my good lord ; But never hope to know why I should marry her . Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed . But follows it , my lord , to bring me down Must answer for your raising ? I know her well : She had her breeding at my father's charge . A poor physician's daughter my wife ! Disdain Rather corrupt me ever ! 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her , the which I can build up . Strange is it that our bloods , Of colour , weight , and heat , pour'd all together , Would quite confound distinction , yet stand off In differences so mighty . If she be All that is virtuous , save what thou dislik'st , A poor physician's daughter , thou dislik'st Of virtue for the name ; but do not so : From lowest place when virtuous things proceed , The place is dignified by the doer's deed : Where great additions swell's , and virtue none , It is a dropsied honour . Good alone Is good without a name : vileness is so : The property by what it is should go , Not by the title . She is young , wise , fair ; In these to nature she's immediate heir , And these breed honour : that is honour's scorn Which challenges itself as honour's born , And is not like the sire : honours thrive When rather from our acts we them derive Than our foregoers . The mere word's a slave , Debosh'd on every tomb , on every grave A lying trophy , and as oft is dumb Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb Of honour'd bones indeed . What should be said ? If thou canst like this creature as a maid , I can create the rest : virtue and she Is her own dower ; honour and wealth from me . I cannot love her , nor will strive to do't . Thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose . That you are well restor'd , my lord , I'm glad : Let the rest go . My honour's at the stake , which to defeat I must produce my power . Here , take her hand , Proud scornful boy , unworthy this good gift , That dost in vile misprision shackle up My love and her desert ; thou canst not dream We , poising us in her defective scale , Shall weigh thee to the beam ; that wilt not know , It is in us to plant thine honour where We please to have it grow . Check thy contempt : Obey our will , which travails in thy good : Believe not thy disdain , but presently Do thine own fortunes that obedient right Which both thy duty owes and our power claims ; Or I will throw thee from my care for ever Into the staggers and the careless lapse Of youth and ignorance ; both my revenge and hate Loosing upon thee , in the name of justice , Without all terms of pity . Speak ; thine answer . Pardon , my gracious lord ; for I submit My fancy to your eyes . When I consider What great creation and what dole of honour Flies where you bid it , I find that she , which late Was in my nobler thoughts most base , is now The praised of the king ; who , so ennobled , Is , as 'twere , born so . Take her by the hand , And tell her she is thine : to whom I promise A counterpoise , if not to thy estate A balance more replete . I take her hand . Good fortune and the favour of the king Smile upon this contract ; whose ceremony Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief , And be perform'd to-night : the solemn feast Shall more attend upon the coming space , Expecting absent friends . As thou lov'st her , Thy love's to me religious ; else , does err . Do you hear , monsieur ? a word with you . Your pleasure , sir ? Your lord and master did well to make his recantation . Recantation ! My lord ! my master ! Ay ; is it not a language I speak ? A most harsh one , and not to be understood without bloody succeeding . My master ! Are you companion to the Count Rousillon ? To any count ; to all counts ; to what is man . To what is count's man : count's master is of another style . You are too old , sir ; let it satisfy you , you are too old . I must tell thee , sirrah , I write man ; to which title age cannot bring thee . What I dare too well do , I dare not do . I did think thee , for two ordinaries , to be a pretty wise fellow : thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel ; it might pass : yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden . I have now found thee ; when I lose thee again , I care not ; yet art thou good for nothing but taking up , and that thou'rt scarce worth . Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee , Do not plunge thyself too far in anger , lest thou hasten thy trial ; which if Lord have mercy on thee for a hen ! So , my good window of lattice , fare thee well : thy casement I need not open , for I look through thee . Give me thy hand . My lord , you give me most egregious indignity . Ay , with all my heart ; and thou art worthy of it . I have not , my lord , deserved it . Yes , good faith , every dram of it ; and I will not bate thee a scruple . Well , I shall be wiser . E'en as soon as thou canst , for thou hast to pull at a smack o' the contrary . If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and beaten , thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage . I have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee , or rather my knowledge , that I may say in the default , he is a man I know . My lord , you do me most insupportable vexation . I would it were hell-pains for thy sake , and my poor doing eternal : for doing I am past ; as I will by thee , in what motion age will give me leave . Well , thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me ; scurvy , old , filthy , scurvy lord ! Well , I must be patient ; there is no fettering of authority . I'll beat him , by my life , if I can meet him with any convenience , an he were double and double a lord . I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have of I'll beat him , an if I could but meet him again ! Sirrah , your lord and master's married ; there's news for you : you have a new mistress . I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs : he is my good lord : whom I serve above is my master . Who ? God ? Ay , sir . The devil it is that's thy master . Why dost thou garter up thy arms o' this fashion ? dost make hose of thy sleeves ? do other servants so ? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands . By mine honour , if I were but two hours younger , I'd beat thee : methinks thou art a general offence , and every man should beat thee : I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee . This is hard and undeserved measure , my lord . Go to , sir ; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate ; you are a vagabond and no true traveller : you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the heraldry of your birth and virtue gives you commission . You are not worth another word , else I'd call you knave . I leave you . Good , very good ; it is so then : good , very good . Let it be concealed awhile . Undone , and forfeited to cares for ever ! What is the matter , sweet heart ? Although before the solemn priest I have sworn , I will not bed her . What , what , sweet heart ? O my Parolles , they have married me ! I'll to the Tuscan wars , and never bed her . France is a dog-hole , and it no more merits The tread of a man's foot . To the wars ! There's letters from my mother : what the import is I know not yet . Ay , that would be known . To the wars , my boy ! to the wars ! He wears his honour in a box , unseen , That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home , Spending his manly marrow in her arms , Which should sustain the bound and high curvet Of Mars's fiery steed . To other regions ! France is a stable ; we that dwell in't jades ; Therefore , to the war ! It shall be so : I'll send her to my house , Acquaint my mother with my hate to her , And wherefore I am fled ; write to the king That which I durst not speak : his present gift Shall furnish me to those Italian fields , Where noble fellows strike . War is no strife To the dark house and the detested wife . Will this capriccio hold in thee ? art sure ? Go with me to my chamber , and advise me . I'll send her straight away : to-morrow I'll to the wars , she to her single sorrow . Why , these balls bound ; there's noise in it . 'Tis hard : A young man married is a man that's marr'd : Therefore away , and leave her bravely ; go : The king has done you wrong : but , hush ! 'tis so . My mother greets me kindly : is she well ? She is not well ; but yet she has her health ; she's very merry ; but yet she is not well : but thanks be given , she's very well , and wants nothing i' the world ; but yet she is not well . If she be very well , what does she ail that she's not very well ? Truly , she's very well indeed , but for two things . What two things ? One , that she's not in heaven , whither God send her quickly ! the other , that she's in earth , from whence God send her quickly ! Bless you , my fortunate lady ! I hope , sir , I have your good will to have mine own good fortunes . You had my prayers to lead them on ; and to keep them on , have them still . O ! my knave , how does my old lady ? So that you had her wrinkles , and I her money , I would she did as you say . Why , I say nothing . Marry , you are the wiser man ; for many a man's tongue shakes out his master's undoing . To say nothing , to do nothing , to know nothing , and to have nothing , is to be a great part of your title ; which is within a very little of nothing . Away ! thou'rt a knave . You should have said , sir , before a knave thou'rt a knave ; that is , before me thou'rt a knave : this had been truth , sir . Go to , thou art a witty fool ; I have found thee . Did you find me in yourself , sir ? or were you taught to find me ? The search , sir , was profitable ; and much fool may you find in you , even to the world's pleasure and the increase of laughter . A good knave , i' faith , and well fed . Madam , my lord will go away to-night ; A very serious business calls on him . The great prerogative and rite of love , Which , as your due , time claims , he does acknowledge , But puts it off to a compell'd restraint ; Whose want , and whose delay , is strew'd with sweets , Which they distil now in the curbed time , To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy , And pleasure drown the brim . What's his will else ? That you will take your instant leave o' the king , And make this haste as your own good proceeding , Strengthen'd with what apology you think May make it probable need . What more commands he ? That , having this obtain'd , you presently Attend his further pleasure . In everything I wait upon his will . I shall report it so . I pray you . Come , sirrah . But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier . Yes , my lord , and of very valiant approof . You have it from his own deliverance . And by other warranted testimony . Then my dial goes not true : I took this lark for a bunting . I do assure you , my lord , he is very great in knowledge , and accordingly valiant . I have then sinned against his experience and transgressed against his valour ; and my state that way is dangerous , since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent . Here he comes ; I pray you , make us friends ; I will pursue the amity . These things shall be done , sir . Pray you , sir , who's his tailor ? Sir ? O ! I know him well . Ay , sir ; he , sir , is a good workman , a very good tailor . Is she gone to the king ? She is . Will she away to-night ? As you'll have her . I have writ my letters , casketed my treasure , Given orders for our horses ; and to-night , When I should take possession of the bride , End ere I do begin . A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner ; but one that lies three thirds , and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings with , should be once heard and thrice beaten . God save you , captain . Is there any unkindness between my lord and you , monsieur ? I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's displeasure . You have made shift to run into't , boots and spurs and all , like him that leaped into the custard ; and out of it you'll run again , rather than suffer question for your residence . It may be you have mistaken him , my lord . And shall do so ever , though I took him at his prayers . Fare you well , my lord ; and believe this of me , there can be no kernel in this light nut ; the soul of this man is his clothes . Trust him not in matter of heavy consequence ; I have kept of them tame , and know their natures . Farewell , monsieur : I have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand ; but we must do good against evil . An idle lord , I swear . I think not so . Why , do you not know him ? Yes , I do know him well ; and common speech Gives him a worthy pass . Here comes my clog . I have , sir , as I was commanded from you , Spoke with the king , and have procur'd his leave For present parting ; only , he desires Some private speech with you . I shall obey his will . You must not marvel , Helen , at my course , Which holds not colour with the time , nor does The ministration and required office On my particular : prepar'd I was not For such a business ; therefore am I found So much unsettled . This drives me to entreat you That presently you take your way for home ; And rather muse than ask why I entreat you ; For my respects are better than they seem , And my appointments have in them a need Greater than shows itself at the first view To you that know them not . This to my mother . 'Twill be two days ere I shall see you , so I leave you to your wisdom . Sir , I can nothing say , But that I am your most obedient servant . Come , come , no more of that . And ever shall With true observance seek to eke out that Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd To equal my great fortune . Let that go : My haste is very great . Farewell : hie home . Pray sir , your pardon . Well , what would you say ? I am not worthy of the wealth I owe , Nor dare I say 'tis mine , and yet it is ; But , like a timorous thief , most fain would steal What law does vouch mine own . What would you have ? Something , and scarce so much : nothing , indeed . I would not tell you what I would , my lord : Faith , yes ; Strangers and foes do sunder , and not kiss . I pray you , stay not , but in haste to horse . I shall not break your bidding , good my lord . Farewell . Go thou toward home ; where I will never come Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum . Away ! and for our flight . Bravely , coragio ! So that from point to point now have you heard The fundamental reasons of this war , Whose great decision hath much blood let forth , And more thirsts after . Holy seems the quarrel Upon your Grace's part ; black and fearful On the opposer . Therefore we marvel much our cousin France Would in so just a business shut his bosom Against our borrowing prayers . Good my lord , The reasons of our state I cannot yield , But like a common and an outward man , That the great figure of a council frames By self-unable motion : therefore dare not Say what I think of it , since I have found Myself in my incertain grounds to fail As often as I guess'd . Be it his pleasure . But I am sure the younger of our nature , That surfeit on their ease , will day by day Come here for physic . Welcome shall they be , And all the honours that can fly from us Shall on them settle . You know your places well ; When better fall , for your avails they fell . To-morrow to the field . It hath happened all as I would have had it , save that he comes not along with her . By my troth , I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man . By what observance , I pray you ? Why , he will look upon his boot and sing ; mend the ruff and sing ; ask questions and sing ; pick his teeth and sing . I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song . Let me see what he writes , and when he means to come . I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court . Our old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court : the brains of my Cupid's knocked out , and I begin to love , as an old man loves money , with no stomach . What have we here ? E'en that you have there . I have sent you a daughter-in-law : she hath recovered the king , and undone me . I have wedded her , not bedded her ; and sworn to make the 'not' eternal . You shall hear I am ran away : know it before the report come . If there be breadth enough in the world , I will hold a long distance . My duty to you . Your unfortunate son , This is not well : rash and unbridled boy , To fly the favours of so good a king ! To pluck his indignation on thy head By the misprising of a maid too virtuous For the contempt of empire ! O madam ! yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady . What is the matter ? Nay , there is some comfort in the news , some comfort ; your son will not be killed so soon as I thought he would . Why should he be killed ? So say I , madam , if he run away , as I hear he does : the danger is in standing to't ; that's the loss of men , though it be the getting of children . Here they come will tell you more ; for my part , I only hear your son was run away . Save you , good madam . Madam , my lord is gone , for ever gone . Do not say so . Think upon patience . Pray you , gentlemen , I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief , That the first face of neither , on the start , Can woman me unto 't : where is my son , I pray you ? Madam , he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence : We met him thitherward ; for thence we came , And , after some dispatch in hand at court , Thither we bend again . Look on his letter , madam ; here's my passport . When thou canst get the ring upon my finger , which never shall come off , and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to , then call me husband : but in such a 'then' I write a 'never .' This is a dreadful sentence . Brought you this letter , gentlemen ? Ay , madam ; And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains . I prithee , lady , have a better cheer ; If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine , Thou robb'st me of a moiety : he was my son , But I do wash his name out of my blood , And thou art all my child . Towards Florence is he ? Ay , madam . And to be a soldier ? Such is his noble purpose ; and , believe't , The duke will lay upon him all the honour That good convenience claims . Return you thither ? Ay , madam , with the swiftest wing of speed . Till I have no wife , I have nothing in France . 'Tis bitter . Find you that there ? Ay , madam . 'Tis but the boldness of his hand , haply , which his heart was not consenting to . Nothing in France until he have no wife ! There's nothing here that is too good for him But only she ; and she deserves a lord That twenty such rude boys might tend upon , And call her hourly mistress . Who was with him ? A servant only , and a gentleman Which I have some time known . Parolles , was it not ? Ay , my good lady , he . A very tainted fellow , and full of wickedness . My son corrupts a well-derived nature With his inducement . Indeed , good lady , The fellow has a deal of that too much , Which holds him much to have . Y'are welcome , gentlemen . I will entreat you , when you see my son , To tell him that his sword can never win The honour that he loses : more I'll entreat you Written to bear along . We serve you , madam , In that and all your worthiest affairs . Not so , but as we change our courtesies . Will you draw near ? 'Till I have no wife , I have nothing in France .' Nothing in France until he has no wife ! Thou shalt have none , Rousillon , none in France ; Then hast thou all again . Poor lord ! is't I That chase thee from thy country , and expose Those tender limbs of thine to the event Of the non-sparing war ? and is it I That drive thee from the sportive court , where thou Wast shot at with fair eyes , to be the mark Of smoky muskets ? O you leaden messengers , That ride upon the violent speed of fire , Fly with false aim ; move the still-piecing air , That sings with piercing ; do not touch my lord ! Whoever shoots at him , I set him there ; Whoever charges on his forward breast , I am the caitiff that do hold him to't ; And , though I kill him not , I am the cause His death was so effected : better 'twere I met the ravin lion when he roar'd With sharp constraint of hunger ; better 'twere That all the miseries which nature owes Were mine at once . No , come thou home , Rousillon , Whence honour but of danger wins a scar , As oft it loses all : I will be gone ; My being here it is that holds thee hence : Shall I stay here to do't ? no , no , although The air of paradise did fan the house , And angels offic'd all : I will be gone , That pitiful rumour may report my flight , To consolate thine ear . Come , night ; end , day ! For with the dark , poor thief , I'll steal away . The general of our horse thou art ; and we , Great in our hope , lay our best love and credence Upon thy promising fortune . Sir , it is A charge too heavy for my strength , but yet We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake To the extreme edge of hazard . Then go thou forth , And fortune play upon thy prosp'rous helm As thy auspicious mistress ! This very day , Great Mars , I put myself into thy file : Make me but like my thoughts , and I shall prove A lover of thy drum , hater of love . Alas ! and would you take the letter of her ? Might you not know she would do as she has done , By sending me a letter ? Read it again . I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim , thither gone : Ambitious love hath so in me offended That bare-foot plod I the cold ground upon With sainted vow my faults to have amended . Write , write , that from the bloody course of war , My dearest master , your dear son , may hie : Bless him at home in peace , whilst I from far His name with zealous fervour sanctify : His taken labours bid him me forgive ; I , his despiteful Juno , sent him forth From courtly friends , with camping foes to live , Where death and danger dog the heels of worth : He is too good and fair for Death and me ; Whom I myself embrace , to set him free . Ah , what sharp stings are in her mildest words ! Rinaldo , you did never lack advice so much , As letting her pass so : had I spoke with her , I could have well diverted her intents , Which thus she hath prevented . Pardon me , madam : If I had given you this at over-night She might have been o'erta'en ; and yet she writes , Pursuit would be but vain . What angel shall Bless this unworthy husband ? he cannot thrive , Unless her prayers , whom heaven delights to hear , And loves to grant , reprieve him from the wrath Of greatest justice . Write , write , Rinaldo , To this unworthy husband of his wife ; Let every word weigh heavy of her worth That he does weigh too light : my greatest grief , Though little he do feel it , set down sharply . Dispatch the most convenient messenger : When haply he shall hear that she is gone , He will return ; and hope I may that she , Hearing so much , will speed her foot again , Led hither by pure love . Which of them both Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense To make distinction . Provide this messenger . My heart is heavy and mine age is weak ; Grief would have tears , and sorrow bids me speak . Nay , come ; for if they do approach the city we shall lose all the sight . They say the French Count has done most honourable service . It is reported that he has taken their greatest commander , and that with his own hand he slew the duke's brother . We have lost our labour ; they are gone a contrary way : hark ! you may know by their trumpets . Come ; let's return again , and suffice ourselves with the report of it . Well , Diana , take heed of this French earl : the honour of a maid is her name , and no legacy is so rich as honesty . I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion . I know that knave ; hang him ! one Parolles : a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl . Beware of them , Diana ; their promises , enticements , oaths , tokens , and all these engines of lust , are not the things they go under : many a maid hath been seduced by them ; and the misery is , example , that so terrible shows in the wrack of maidenhood , cannot for all that dissuade succession , but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them . I hope I need not to advise you further ; but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are , though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost . You shall not need to fear me . I hope so . Look , here comes a pilgrim : I know she will lie at my house ; thither they send one another . I'll question her . God save you , pilgrim ! whither are you bound ? To Saint Jaques le Grand . Where do the palmers lodge , I do beseech you ? At the Saint Francis , here beside the port . Is this the way ? Ay , marry , is't . Hark you ! They come this way . If you will tarry , holy pilgrim , But till the troops come by , I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd : The rather , for I think I know your hostess As ample as myself . Is it yourself ? If you shall please so , pilgrim . I thank you , and will stay upon your leisure . You came , I think , from France ? I did so . Here you shall see a countryman of yours That has done worthy service . His name , I pray you . The Count Rousillon : know you such a one ? But by the ear , that hears most nobly of him ; His face I know not . Whatsoe'er he is , He's bravely taken here . He stole from France , As 'tis reported , for the king had married him Against his liking . Think you it is so ? Ay , surely , mere the truth : I know his lady . There is a gentleman that serves the count Reports but coarsely of her . What's his name ? Monsieur Parolles . O ! I believe with him , In argument of praise , or to the worth Of the great count himself , she is too mean To have her name repeated : all her deserving Is a reserved honesty , and that I have not heard examin'd . Alas , poor lady ! 'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife Of a detesting lord . Ay , right ; good creature , wheresoe'er she is , Her heart weighs sadly . This young maid might do her A shrewd turn if she pleas'd . How do you mean ? May be the amorous count solicits her In the unlawful purpose . He does , indeed ; And brokes with all that can in such a suit Corrupt the tender honour of a maid : But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard In honestest defence . The gods forbid else ! So , now they come . That is Antonio , the duke's eldest son ; That , Escalus . Which is the Frenchman ? He ; That with the plume : 'tis a most gallant fellow ; I would he lov'd his wife . If he were honester , He were much goodlier ; is't not a handsome gentleman ? I like him well . 'Tis pity he is not honest . Yond's that same knave That leads him to these places : were I his lady I would poison that vile rascal . Which is he ? That jack-an-apes with scarfs . Why is he melancholy ? Perchance he's hurt i' the battle . Lose our drum ! well . He's shrewdly vexed at something . Look , he has spied us . Marry , hang you ! And your courtesy , for a ring-carrier ! The troop is past . Come , pilgrim , I will bring you Where you shall host : of enjoin'd penitents There's four or five , to great Saint Jaques bound , Already at my house . I humbly thank you . Please it this matron and this gentle maid To eat with us to-night , the charge and thanking Shall be for me ; and , to requite you further , I will bestow some precepts of this virgin Worthy the note . We'll take your offer kindly . Nay , good my lord , put him to't : let him have his way . If your lordship find him not a hilding , hold me no more in your respect . On my life , my lord , a bubble . Do you think I am so far deceived in him ? Believe it , my lord , in mine own direct knowledge , without any malice , but to speak of him as my kinsman , he's a most notable coward , an infinite and endless liar , an hourly promise-breaker , the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment . It were fit you knew him ; lest , reposing too far in his virtue , which he hath not , he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you . I would I knew in what particular action to try him . None better than to let him fetch off his drum , which you hear him so confidently undertake to do . I , with a troop of Florentines , will suddenly surprise him : such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy . We will bind and hood wink him so , that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries , when we bring him to our own tents . Be but your lordship present at his examination : if he do not , for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear , offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you , and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath , never trust my judgment in anything . O ! for the love of laughter , let him fetch his drum : he says he has a stratagem for't . When your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't , and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted , if you give him not John Drum's entertainment , your inclining cannot be removed . Here he comes . O ! for the love of laughter , hinder not the honour of his design : let him fetch off his drum in any hand . How now , monsieur ! this drum sticks sorely in your disposition . A pox on't ! let it go : 'tis but a drum . 'But a drum !' Is't 'but a drum ?' A drum so lost ! There was excellent command , to charge in with our horse upon our own wings , and to rend our own soldiers ! That was not to be blamed in the command of the service : it was a disaster of war that C sar himself could not have prevented if he had been there to command . Well , we cannot greatly condemn our success : some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum ; but it is not to be recovered . It might have been recovered . It might ; but it is not now . It is to be recovered . But that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer , I would have that drum or another , or hic jacet . Why , if you have a stomach to't , monsieur , if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into its native quarter , be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on ; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit : if you speed well in it , the duke shall both speak of it , and extend to you what further becomes his greatness , even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness . By the hand of a soldier , I will undertake it . But you must not now slumber in it . I'll about it this evening : and I will presently pen down my dilemmas , encourage myself in my certainty , put myself into my mortal preparation , and by midnight look to hear further from me . May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it ? I know not what the success will be , my lord ; but the attempt I vow . I know thou'rt valiant ; and , to the possibility of thy soldiership , will subscribe for thee . Farewell . I love not many words . No more than a fish loves water . Is not this a strange fellow , my lord , that so confidently seems to undertake this business , which he knows is not to be done ; damns himself to do , and dares better be damned than to do't ? You do not know him , my lord , as we do : certain it is , that he will steal himself into a man's favour , and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries ; but when you find him out you have him ever after . Why , do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto ? None in the world ; but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies . But we have almost embossed him , you shall see his fall to-night ; for , indeed , he is not for your lordship's respect . We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him . He was first smoked by the old Lord Lafeu : when his disguise and he is parted , tell me what a sprat you shall find him ; which you shall see this very night . I must go look my twigs : he shall be caught . Your brother he shall go along with me . As't please your lordship : I'll leave you . Now will I lead you to the house , and show you The lass I spoke of . But you say she's honest . That's all the fault . I spoke with her but once , And found her wondrous cold ; but I sent to her , By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind , Tokens and letters which she did re-send ; And this is all I have done . She's a fair creature ; Will you go see her ? With all my heart , my lord . If you misdoubt me that I am not she , I know not how I shall assure you further , But I shall lose the grounds I work upon . Though my estate be fall'n , I was well born , Nothing acquainted with these businesses ; And would not put my reputation now In any staining act . Nor would I wish you . First , give me trust , the county is my husband , And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken Is so from word to word ; and then you cannot , By the good aid that I of you shall borrow , Err in bestowing it . I should believe you : For you have show'd me that which well approves You're great in fortune . Take this purse of gold , And let me buy your friendly help thus far , Which I will over-pay and pay again When I have found it . The county woos your daughter , Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty , Resolv'd to carry her : let her in fine consent , As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it . Now , his important blood will nought deny That she'll demand : a ring the county wears , That down ward hath succeeded in his house From son to son , some four or five descents Since the first father wore it : this ring he holds In most rich choice ; yet , in his idle fire , To buy his will , it would not seem too dear , Howe'er repented after . Now I see The bottom of your purpose . You see it lawful then . It is no more , But that your daughter , ere she seems as won , Desires this ring , appoints him an encounter , In fine , delivers me to fill the time , Herself most chastely absent . After this , To marry her , I'll add three thousand crowns To what is past already . I have yielded . Instruct my daughter how she shall persever , That time and place with this deceit so lawful May prove coherent . Every night he comes With musics of all sorts and songs compos'd To her unworthiness : it nothing steads us To chide him from our eaves , for he persists As if his life lay on't . Why then to-night Let us assay our plot ; which , if it speed , Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed , And lawful meaning in a lawful act , Where both not sin , and yet a sinful fact . But let's about it . He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner . When you sally upon him , speak what terrible language you will : though you understand it not yourselves , no matter ; for we must not seem to understand him , unless some one among us , whom we must produce for an interpreter . Good captain , let me be the interpreter . Art not acquainted with him ? knows he not thy voice ? No , sir , I warrant you . But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again ? Even such as you speak to me . He must think us some band of strangers i' the adversary's entertainment . Now , he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages ; therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy , not to know what we speak one to another ; so we seem to know , is to know straight our purpose : chough's language , gabble enough , and good enough . As for you , interpreter , you must seem very politic . But couch , ho ! here he comes , to beguile two hours in a sleep , and then to return and swear the lies he forges . Ten o'clock : within these three hours 'twill be time enough to go home . What shall I say I have done ? It must be a very plausive invention that carries it . They begin to smoke me , and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door . I find my tongue is too foolhardy ; but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it and of his creatures , not daring the reports of my tongue . This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of . What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum , being not ignorant of the impossibility , and knowing I had no such purpose ? I must give myself some hurts and say I got them in exploit . Yet slight ones will not carry it : they will say , 'Came you off with so little ?' and great ones I dare not give . Wherefore , what's the instance ? Tongue , I must put you into a butter-woman's mouth , and buy myself another of Bajazet's mute , if you prattle me into these perils . Is it possible he should know what he is , and be that he is ? I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn or the breaking of my Spanish sword . We cannot afford you so . Or the baring of my beard , and to say it was in stratagem . 'Twould not do . Or to drown my clothes , and say I was stripped . Hardly serve . Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel How deep ? Thirty fathom . Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed . I would I had any drum of the enemy's : I would swear I recovered it . Thou shalt hear one anon . A drum now of the enemy's ! Throca movousus , cargo , cargo , cargo . Cargo , cargo , villianda par corbo , cargo . O ! ransom , ransom ! Do not hide mine eyes . Boskos thromuldo boskos . I know you are the Muskos' regiment ; And I shall lose my life for want of language . If there be here German , or Dane , low Dutch , Italian , or French , let him speak to me : I will discover that which shall undo The Florentine . Boskos vauvado : I understand thee , and can speak thy tongue : Kerelybonto : Sir , Betake thee to thy faith , for seventeen poniards Are at thy bosom .
