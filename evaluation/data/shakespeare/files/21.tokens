I'll pheeze you , in faith . A pair of stocks , you rogue ! Y'are a baggage : the Slys are no rogues ; look in the chronicles ; we came in with Richard Conqueror . Therefore , paucas pallabris ; let the world slide . Sessa ! You will not pay for the glasses you have burst ? No , not a denier . Go by , Jeronimy , go to thy cold bed , and warm thee . I know my remedy : I must go fetch the third-borough . Third , or fourth , or fifth borough , I'll answer him by law . I'll not budge an inch , boy : let him come , and kindly . Huntsman , I charge thee , tender well my hounds : Brach Merriman , the poor cur is emboss'd , And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach . Saw'st thou not , boy , how Silver made it good At the hedge-corner , in the coldest fault ? I would not lose the dog for twenty pound . Why , Bellman is as good as he , my lord ; He cried upon it at the merest loss , And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent : Trust me , I take him for the better dog . Thou art a fool : if Echo were as fleet , I would esteem him worth a dozen such . But sup them well , and look unto them all : To-morrow I intend to hunt again . I will , my lord . What's here ? one dead , or drunk ? See , doth he breathe ? He breathes , my lord . Were he not warm'd with ale , This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly . O monstrous beast ! how like a swine he lies ! Grim death , how foul and loathsome is thine image ! Sirs , I will practise on this drunken man . What think you , if he were convey'd to bed , Wrapp'd in sweet clothes , rings put upon his fingers , A most delicious banquet by his bed , And brave attendants near him when he wakes , Would not the beggar then forget himself ? Believe me , lord , I think he cannot choose . It would seem strange unto him when he wak'd . Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy . Then take him up and manage well the jest . Carry him gently to my fairest chamber , And hang it round with all my wanton pictures ; Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters , And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet . Procure me music ready when he wakes , To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound ; And if he chance to speak , be ready straight , And with a low submissive reverence Say , 'What is it your honour will command ?' Let one attend him with a silver basin Full of rose-water , and bestrew'd with flowers ; Another bear the ewer , the third a diaper , And say , 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands ?' Some one be ready with a costly suit , And ask him what apparel he will wear ; Another tell him of his hounds and horse , And that his lady mourns at his disease . Persuade him that he hath been lunatic ; And , when he says he is say that he dreams , For he is nothing but a mighty lord . This do , and do it kindly , gentle sirs : It will be pastime passing excellent , If it be husbanded with modesty . My lord , I warrant you we will play our part , As he shall think , by our true diligence , He is no less than what we say he is . Take him up gently , and to bed with him , And each one to his office when he wakes . Sirrah , go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds : Belike , some noble gentleman that means , Travelling some journey , to repose him here . How now ! who is it ? An it please your honour , Players that offer service to your lordship . Bid them come near . Now , fellows , you are welcome . We thank your honour . Do you intend to stay with me to-night ? So please your lordship to accept our duty . With all my heart . This fellow I remember , Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son : 'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well . I have forgot your name ; but , sure , that part Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd . I think 'twas Soto that your honour means . 'Tis very true : thou didst it excellent . Well , you are come to me in happy time , The rather for I have some sport in hand Wherein your cunning can assist me much . There is a lord will hear you play to-night ; But I am doubtful of your modesties , Lest , over-eyeing of his odd behaviour , For yet his honour never heard a play , You break into some merry passion And so offend him ; for I tell you , sirs , If you should smile he grows impatient . Fear not , my lord : we can contain ourselves Were he the veriest antick in the world . Go , sirrah , take them to the buttery , And give them friendly welcome every one : Let them want nothing that my house affords . Sirrah , go you to Barthol'mew my page , And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady : That done , conduct him to the drunkard's chamber ; And call him 'madam ,' do him obeisance . Tell him from me ,as he will win my love , He bear himself with honourable action , Such as he hath observ'd in noble ladies Unto their lords , by them accomplished : Such duty to the drunkard let him do With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy ; And say , 'What is't your honour will command , Wherein your lady and your humble wife May show her duty , and make known her love ?' And then , with kind embracements , tempting kisses , And with declining head into his bosom , Bid him shed tears , as being overjoy'd To see her noble lord restor'd to health , Who for this seven years hath esteemed him No better than a poor and loathsome beggar . And if the boy have not a woman's gift To rain a shower of commanded tears , An onion will do well for such a shift , Which in a napkin being close convey'd , Shall in despite enforce a watery eye . See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst : Anon I'll give thee more instructions . I know the boy will well usurp the grace , Voice , gait , and action of a gentlewoman : I long to hear him call the drunkard husband , And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant . I'll in to counsel them : haply , my presence May well abate the over merry spleen Which otherwise would grow into extremes . For God's sake ! a pot of small ale . Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack ? Will't please your honour taste of these conserves ? What raiment will your honour wear to-day ? I am Christophero Sly ; call not me honour , nor lordship : I ne'er drank sack in my life ; and if you give me any conserves , give me conserves of beef . Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear , for I have no more doublets than backs , no more stockings than legs , nor no more shoes than feet : nay , sometime more feet than shoes , or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather . Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour ! O , that a mighty man , of such descent , Of such possessions , and so high esteem , Should be infused with so foul a spirit ! What ! would you make me mad ? Am not I Christopher Sly , old Sly's son , of Burtonheath ; by birth a pedlar , by education a cardmaker , by transmutation a bear-herd , and now by present profession a tinker ? Ask Marian Hacket , the fat ale-wife of Wincot , if she know me not : if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale , score me up for the lyingest knave in Christendom . What ! I am not bestraught : here's O ! this it is that makes your lady mourn . O ! this it is that makes your servants droop . Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house , As beaten hence by your strange lunacy . O noble lord , bethink thee of thy birth , Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment , And banish hence these abject lowly dreams . Look how thy servants do attend on thee , Each in his office ready at thy beck : Wilt thou have music ? hark ! Apollo plays , And twenty caged nightingales do sing : Or wilt thou sleep ? we'll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis . Say thou wilt walk , we will bestrew the ground : Or wilt thou ride ? thy horses shall be trapp'd , Their harness studded all with gold and pearl . Dost thou love hawking ? thou hast hawks will soar Above the morning lark : or wilt thou hunt ? Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them , And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth . Say thou wilt course ; thy greyhounds are as swift As breathed stags , ay , fleeter than the roe . Dost thou love pictures ? we will fetch thee straight Adonis painted by a running brook , And Cytherea all in sedges hid , Which seem to move and wanton with her breath , Even as the waving sedges play with wind . We'll show thee Io as she was a maid , And how she was beguiled and surpris'd , As lively painted as the deed was done . Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood , Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds ; And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep , So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn . Thou art a lord and nothing but a lord : Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age . And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face , She was the fairest creature in the world ; And yet she is inferior to none . Am I a lord ? and have I such a lady ? Or do I dream ? or have I dream'd till now ? I do not sleep ; I see , I hear , I speak ; I smell sweet savours , and I feel soft things : Upon my life , I am a lord indeed ; And not a tinker , nor Christophero Sly . Well , bring our lady hither to our sight ; And once again , a pot o' the smallest ale . Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands ? O , how we joy to see your wit restor'd ! O , that once more you knew but what you are ! These fifteen years you have been in a dream , Or , when you wak'd , so wak'd as if you slept . These fifteen years ! by my fay , a goodly nap . But did I never speak of all that time ? O ! yes , my lord , but very idle words ; For though you lay here in this goodly chamber , Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door , And rail upon the hostess of the house , And say you would present her at the leet , Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts . Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket . Ay , the woman's maid of the house . Why , sir , you know no house , nor no such maid , Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up , As Stephen Sly , and old John Naps of Greece , And Peter Turf , and Henry Pimpernell , And twenty more such names and men as these , Which never were nor no man ever saw . Now , Lord be thanked for my good amends ! Amen . I thank thee ; thou shalt not lose by it . How fares my noble lord ? Marry , I fare well , for here is cheer enough . Where is my wife ? Here , noble lord : what is thy will with her ? Are you my wife , and will not call me husband ? My men should call me lord : I am your goodman . My husband and my lord , my lord and husband ; I am your wife in all obedience . I know it well . What must I call her ? Madam . Al'ce madam , or Joan madam ? Madam , and nothing else : so lords call ladies . Madam wife , they say that I have dream'd And slept above some fifteen year or more . Ay , and the time seems thirty unto me , Being all this time abandon'd from your bed . 'Tis much . Servants , leave me and her alone . Madam , undress you , and come now to bed . Thrice noble lord , let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two , Or , if not so , until the sun be set : For your physicians have expressly charg'd , In peril to incur your former malady , That I should yet absent me from your bed : I hope this reason stands for my excuse . Ay , it stands so , that I may hardly tarry so long ; but I would be loath to fall into my dreams again : I will therefore tarry , in spite of the flesh and the blood . Your honour's players , hearing your amendment , Are come to play a pleasant comedy ; For so your doctors hold it very meet , Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood , And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy : Therefore they thought it good you hear a play , And frame your mind to mirth and merriment , Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life . Marry , I will ; let them play it . Is not a commonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick ? No , my good lord ; it is more pleasing stuff . What ! household stuff ? It is a kind of history . Well , we'll see't . Come , madam wife , sit by my side , And let the world slip : we shall ne'er be younger . Tranio , since for the great desire I had To see fair Padua , nursery of arts , I am arriv'd for fruitful Lombardy , The pleasant garden of great Italy ; And by my father's love and leave am arm'd With his good will and thy good company , My trusty servant well approv'd in all , Here let us breathe , and haply institute A course of learning and ingenious studies . Pisa , renowned for grave citizens , Gave me my being and my father first , A merchant of great traffic through the world , Vincentio , come of the Bentivolii . Vincentio's son , brought up in Florence , It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv'd , To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds : And therefore , Tranio , for the time I study , Virtue and that part of philosophy Will I apply that treats of happiness By virtue specially to be achiev'd . Tell me thy mind ; for I have Pisa left And am to Padua come , as he that leaves A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep , And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst . Mi perdonate , gentle master mine , I am in all affected as yourself , Glad that you thus continue your resolve To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy . Only , good master , while we do admire This virtue and this moral discipline , Let's be no stoics nor no stocks , I pray ; Or so devote to Aristotle's checks As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd . Balk logic with acquaintance that you have , And practise rhetoric in your common talk ; Music and poesy use to quicken you ; The mathematics and the metaphysics , Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you ; No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en ; In brief , sir , study what you most affect . Gramercies , Tranio , well dost thou advise . If , Biondello , thou wert come ashore , We could at once put us in readiness , And take a lodging fit to entertain Such friends as time in Padua shall beget . But stay awhile : what company is this ? Master , some show to welcome us to town . Gentlemen , importune me no further , For how I firmly am resolv'd you know ; That is , not to bestow my youngest daughter Before I have a husband for the elder . If either of you both love Katharina , Because I know you well and love you well , Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure . To cart her rather : she's too rough for me . There , there , Hortensio , will you any wife ? I pray you , sir , is it your will To make a stale of me amongst these mates ? Mates , maid ! how mean you that ? no mates for you , Unless you were of gentler , milder mould . I' faith , sir , you shall never need to fear : I wis it is not half way to her heart ; But if it were , doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool , And paint your face , and use you like a fool . From all such devils , good Lord deliver us ! And me too , good Lord ! Hush , master ! here is some good pastime toward : That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward . But in the other's silence do I see Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety . Peace , Tranio ! Well said , master ; mum ! and gaze your fill . Gentlemen , that I may soon make good What I have said ,Bianca , get you in : And let it not displease thee , good Bianca , For I will love thee ne'er the less , my girl . A pretty peat ! it is best Put finger in the eye , an she knew why . Sister , content you in my discontent . Sir , to your pleasure humbly I subscribe : My books and instruments shall be my company , On them to look and practise by myself . Hark , Tranio ! thou mayst hear Minerva speak . Signior Baptista , will you be so strange ? Sorry am I that our good will effects Bianca's grief . Why will you mew her up , Signior Baptista , for this fiend of hell , And make her bear the penance of her tongue ? Gentlemen , content ye ; I am resolv'd . Go in , Bianca . And for I know she taketh most delight In music , instruments , and poetry , Schoolmasters will I keep within my house , Fit to instruct her youth . If you , Hortensio , Or Signior Gremio , you , know any such , Prefer them hither ; for to cunning men I will be very kind , and liberal To mine own children in good bringing up ; And so , farewell . Katharina , you may stay ; For I have more to commune with Bianca . Why , and I trust I may go too ; may I not ? What ! shall I be appointed hours , as though , belike , I knew not what to take , and what to leave ? Ha ! You may go to the devil's dam : your gifts are so good , here's none will hold you . Their love is not so great , Hortensio , but we may blow our nails together , and fast it fairly out : our cake's dough on both sides . Farewell : yet , for the love I bear my sweet Bianca , if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights , I will wish him to her father . So will I , Signior Gremio : but a word , I pray . Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle , know now , upon advice , it toucheth us both ,that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca's love ,to labour and effect one thing specially . What's that , I pray ? Marry , sir , to get a husband for her sister . A husband ! a devil . I say , a husband . I say , a devil . Thinkest thou , Hortensio , though her father be very rich , any man is so very a fool to be married to hell ? Tush , Gremio ! though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums , why , man , there be good fellows in the world , an a man could light on them , would take her with all faults , and money enough . I cannot tell ; but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition , to be whipped at the high-cross every morning . Faith , as you say , there's small choice in rotten apples . But , come ; since this bar in law makes us friends , it shall be so far forth friendly maintained , till by helping Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband , we set his youngest free for a husband , and then have to't afresh . Sweet Bianca ! Happy man be his dole ! He that runs fastest gets the ring . How say you , Signior Gremio ? I am agreed : and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing , that would thoroughly woo her , wed her , and bed her , and rid the house of her . Come on . I pray , sir , tell me , is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold ? O Tranio ! till I found it to be true , I never thought it possible or likely ; But see , while idly I stood looking on , I found the effect of love in idleness ; And now in plainness do confess to thee , That art to me as secret and as dear As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was , Tranio , I burn , I pine , I perish , Tranio , If I achieve not this young modest girl . Counsel me , Tranio , for I know thou canst : Assist me , Tranio , for I know thou wilt . Master , it is no time to chide you now ; Affection is not rated from the heart : If love have touch'd you , nought remains but so , Redime te captum , quam queas minimo . Gramercies , lad ; go forward : this contents : The rest will comfort , for thy counsel's sound . Master , you look'd so longly on the maid , Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all . O yes , I saw sweet beauty in her face , Such as the daughter of Agenor had , That made great Jove to humble him to her hand , When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand . Saw you no more ? mark'd you not how her sister Began to scold and raise up such a storm That mortal ears might hardly endure the din ? Tranio , I saw her coral lips to move , And with her breath she did perfume the air ; Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her . Nay , then , 'tis time to stir him from his trance . I pray , awake , sir : if you love the maid , Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her . Thus it stands : Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd , That till the father rid his hands of her , Master , your love must live a maid at home ; And therefore has he closely mew'd her up , Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors . Ah , Tranio , what a cruel father's he ! But art thou not advis'd he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her ? Ay , marry , am I , sir ; and now 'tis plotted . I have it , Tranio . Master , for my hand , Both our inventions meet and jump in one . Tell me thine first . You will be schoolmaster , And undertake the teaching of the maid : That's your device . It is : may it be done ? Not possible ; for who shall bear your part , And be in Padua here Vincentio's son ? Keep house and ply his book , welcome his friends ; Visit his countrymen , and banquet them ? Basta ; content thee ; for I have it full . We have not yet been seen in any house , Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces For man , or master : then , it follows thus : Thou shalt be master , Tranio , in my stead , Keep house , and port , and servants , as I should : I will some other be ; some Florentine , Some Neapolitan , or meaner man of Pisa . 'Tis hatch'd and shall be so : Tranio , at once Uncase thee , take my colour'd hat and cloak : When Biondello comes , he waits on thee ; But I will charm him first to keep his tongue . So had you need . In brief then , sir , sith it your pleasure is , And I am tied to be obedient ; For so your father charg'd me at our parting , 'Be serviceable to my son ,' quoth he , Although I think 'twas in another sense : I am content to be Lucentio , Because so well I love Lucentio . Tranio , be so , because Lucentio loves ; And let me be a slave , to achieve that maid Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye . Here comes the rogue . Sirrah , where have you been ? Where have I been ! Nay , how now ! where are you ? Master , has my fellow Tranio stol'n your clothes , Or you stol'n his ? or both ? pray , what's the news ? Sirrah , come hither : 'tis no time to jest , And therefore frame your manners to the time . Your fellow Tranio , here , to save my life , Puts my apparel and my countenance on , And I for my escape have put on his ; For in a quarrel since I came ashore I kill'd a man , and fear I was descried . Wait you on him , I charge you , as becomes , While I make way from hence to save my life : You understand me ? I , sir ! ne'er a whit . And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth : Tranio is changed to Lucentio . The better for him : would I were so too ! So would I , faith , boy , to have the next wish after , That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter . But , sirrah , not for my sake , but your master's , I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies : When I am alone , why , then I am Tranio ; But in all places else your master , Lucentio . Tranio , let's go . One thing more rests , that thyself execute , to make one among these wooers : if thou ask me why , sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty . My lord , you nod ; you do not mind the play . Yes , by Saint Anne , I do . A good matter , surely : comes there any more of it ? My lord , 'tis but begun . 'Tis a very excellent piece of work , madam lady : would 'twere done ! Verona , for awhile I take my leave , To see my friends in Padua ; but , of all My best beloved and approved friend , Hortensio ; and I trow this is his house . Here , sirrah Grumio ; knock , I say . Knock , sir ! whom should I knock ? is there any man has rebused your worship ? Villain , I say , knock me here soundly . Knock you here , sir ! why , sir , what am I , sir , that I should knock you here , sir ? Villain , I say , knock me at this gate ; And rap me well , or I'll knock your knave's pate . My master is grown quarrelsome . I should knock you first , And then I know after who comes by the worst . Will it not be ? Faith , sirrah , an you'll not knock , I'll ring it ; I'll try how you can sol , fa , and sing it . Help , masters , help ! my master is mad . Now , knock when I bid you , sirrah villain ! How now ! what's the matter ? My old friend Grumio ! and my good friend Petruchio ! How do you all at Verona ? Signior Hortensio , come you to part the fray ? Con tutto il cuore ben trovato , may I say . Alla nostra casa ben venuto ; molto honorato signior mio Petruchio . Rise , Grumio , rise : we will compound this quarrel . Nay , 'tis no matter , sir , what he 'leges in Latin . If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service , look you , sir , he bid me knock him and rap him soundly , sir : well , was it fit for a servant to use his master so ; being , perhaps , for aught I see , two-and-thirty , a pip out ? Whom would to God , I had well knock'd at first , Then had not Grumio come by the worst . A senseless villain ! Good Hortensio , I bade the rascal knock upon your gate , And could not get him for my heart to do it . Knock at the gate ! O heavens ! Spake you not these words plain , 'Sirrah , knock me here , rap me here , knock me well , and knock me soundly ?' And come you now with 'knocking at the gate ?' Sirrah , be gone , or talk not , I advise you . Petruchio , patience ; I am Grumio's pledge . Why , this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you , Your ancient , trusty , pleasant servant Grumio . And tell me now , sweet friend , what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona ? Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes further than at home , Where small experience grows . But in a few , Signior Hortensio , thus it stands with me : Antonio , my father , is deceas'd , And I have thrust myself into this maze , Haply to wive and thrive as best I may . Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home , And so am come abroad to see the world . Petruchio , shall I then come roundly to thee , And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife ? Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel ; And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich , And very rich : but thou'rt too much my friend , And I'll not wish thee to her . Signior Hortensio , 'twixt such friends as we , Few words suffice ; and therefore , if thou know One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife , As wealth is burden of my wooing dance , Be she as foul as was Florentius' love , As old as Sibyl , and as curst and shrewd As Socrates' Xanthippe , or a worse , She moves me not , or not removes , at least , Affection's edge in me , were she as rough As are the swelling Adriatic seas : I come to wive it wealthily in Padua ; If wealthily , then happily in Padua . Nay , look you , sir , he tells you flatly what his mind is : why , give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby ; or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head , though she have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses : why , nothing comes amiss , so money comes withal . Petruchio , since we are stepp'd thus far in , I will continue that I broach'd in jest . I can , Petruchio , help thee to a wife With wealth enough , and young and beauteous , Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman : Her only fault ,and that is faults enough , Is , that she is intolerable curst And shrewd and froward , so beyond all measure , That , were my state far worser than it is , I would not wed her for a mine of gold : Hortensio , peace ! thou know'st not gold's effect : Tell me her father's name , and 'tis enough ; For I will board her , though she chide as loud As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack . Her father is Baptista Minola , An affable and courteous gentleman ; Her name is Katharina Minola , Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue . I know her father , though I know not her ; And he knew my deceased father well . I will not sleep , Hortensio , till I see her ; And therefore let me be thus bold with you , To give you over at this first encounter , Unless you will accompany me thither . I pray you , sir , let him go while the humour lasts . O' my word , an she knew him as well as I do , she would think scolding would do little good upon him . She may , perhaps , call him half a score knaves or so : why , that's nothing : an he begin once , he'll rail in his ropetricks . I'll tell you what , sir , an she stand him but a little , he will throw a figure in her face , and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat . You know him not , sir . Tarry , Petruchio , I must go with thee , For in Baptista's keep my treasure is : He hath the jewel of my life in hold , His youngest daughter , beautiful Bianca , And her withholds from me and other more , Suitors to her and rivals in my love ; Supposing it a thing impossible , For those defects I have before rehears'd , That ever Katharina will be woo'd : Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en , That none shall have access unto Bianca , Till Katharine the curst have got a husband . Katharine the curst ! A title for a maid of all titles the worst . Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace , And offer me , disguis'd in sober robes , To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music , to instruct Bianca ; That so I may , by this device , at least Have leave and leisure to make love to her , And unsuspected court her by herself . Here's no knavery ! See , to beguile the old folks , how the young folks lay their heads together ! Master , master , look about you : who goes there , ha ? Peace , Grumio ! 'tis the rival of my love . Petruchio , stand by awhile . A proper stripling , and an amorous ! O ! very well ; I have perus'd the note . Hark you , sir ; I'll have them very fairly bound : All books of love , see that at any hand , And see you read no other lectures to her . You understand me . Over and beside Signior Baptista's liberality , I'll mend it with a largess . Take your papers too , And let me have them very well perfum'd ; For she is sweeter than perfume itself To whom they go to . What will you read to her ? Whate'er I read to her , I'll plead for you , As for my patron , stand you so assur'd , As firmly as yourself were still in place ; Yea , and perhaps with more successful words Than you , unless you were a scholar , sir . O ! this learning , what a thing it is . O ! this woodcock , what an ass it is . Peace , sirrah ! Grumio , mum ! God save you , Signior Gremio ! And you're well met , Signior Hortensio . Trow you whither I am going ? To Baptista Minola . I promis'd to inquire carefully About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca ; And , by good fortune , I have lighted well On this young man ; for learning and behaviour Fit for her turn ; well read in poetry And other books , good ones , I warrant ye . 'Tis well : and I have met a gentleman Hath promis'd me to help me to another , A fine musician to instruct our mistress : So shall I no whit be behind in duty To fair Bianca , so belov'd of me . Belov'd of me , and that my deeds shall prove . And that his bags shall prove . Gremio , 'tis now no time to vent our love : Listen to me , and if you speak me fair , I'll tell you news indifferent good for either . Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met , Upon agreement from us to his liking , Will undertake to woo curst Katharine ; Yea , and to marry her , if her dowry please . So said , so done , is well . Hortensio , have you told him all her faults ? I know she is an irksome , brawling scold : If that be all , masters , I hear no harm . No , sayst me so , friend ? What countryman ? Born in Verona , old Antonio's son : My father dead , my fortune lives for me ; And I do hope good days and long to see . O , sir , such a life , with such a wife , were strange ! But if you have a stomach , to't i' God's name : You shall have me assisting you in all . But will you woo this wild-cat ? Will I live ? Will he woo her ? ay , or I'll hang her . Why came I hither but to that intent ? Think you a little din can daunt mine ears ? Have I not in my time heard lions roar ? Have I not heard the sea , puff'd up with winds , Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat ? Have I not heard great ordnance in the field , And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies ? Have I not in a pitched battle heard Loud 'larums , neighing steeds , and trumpets' clang ? And do you tell me of a woman's tongue , That gives not half so great a blow to hear As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire ? Tush , tush ! fear boys with bugs . For he fears none . Hortensio , hark : This gentleman is happily arriv'd , My mind presumes , for his own good and ours . I promis'd we would be contributors , And bear his charge of wooing , whatsoe'er . And so we will , provided that he win her . I would I were as sure of a good dinner . Gentlemen , God save you ! If I may be bold , Tell me , I beseech you , which is the readiest way To the house of Signior Baptista Minola ? He that has the two fair daughters : is't he you mean ? Even he , Biondello ! Hark you , sir ; you mean not her to Perhaps , him and her , sir : what have you to do ? Not her that chides , sir , at any hand , I pray . I love no chiders , sir . Biondello , let's away . Well begun , Tranio . Sir , a word ere you go : Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of , yea or no ? And if I be , sir , is it any offence ? No ; if without more words you will get you hence . Why , sir , I pray , are not the streets as free For me as for you ? But so is not she . For what reason , I beseech you ? For this reason , if you'll know , That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio . That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio . Softly , my masters ! if you be gentlemen , Do me this right ; hear me with patience . Baptista is a noble gentleman , To whom my father is not all unknown ; And were his daughter fairer than she is , She may more suitors have , and me for one . Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers ; Then well one more may fair Bianca have , And so she shall ; Lucentio shall make one , Though Paris came in hope to speed alone . What ! this gentleman will out-talk us all . Sir , give him head : I know he'll prove a jade . Hortensio , to what end are all these words ? Sir , let me be so bold as ask you , Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter ? No , sir ; but hear I do that he hath two , The one as famous for a scolding tongue As is the other for beauteous modesty . Sir , sir , the first's for me ; let her go by . Yea , leave that labour to great Hercules , And let it be more than Alcides' twelve . Sir , understand you this of me in sooth : The youngest daughter , whom you hearken for , Her father keeps from all access of suitors , And will not promise her to any man Until the elder sister first be wed ; The younger then is free , and not before . If it be so , sir , that you are the man Must stead us all , and me among the rest ; And if you break the ice , and do this feat , Achieve the elder , set the younger free For our access , whose hap shall be to have her Will not so graceless be to be ingrate . Sir , you say well , and well you do conceive ; And since you do profess to be a suitor , You must , as we do , gratify this gentleman , To whom we all rest generally beholding . Sir , I shall not be slack : in sign whereof , Please ye we may contrive this afternoon , And quaff carouses to our mistress' health , And do as adversaries do in law , Strive mightily , but eat and drink as friends . O excellent motion ! Fellows , let's be gone . O excellent motion ! Fellows , let's be gone . The motion's good indeed , and be it so : Petruchio , I shall be your ben venuto . Good sister , wrong me not , nor wrong yourself , To make a bondmaid and a slave of me ; That I disdain : but for these other gawds , Unbind my hands , I'll pull them off myself , Yea , all my raiment , to my petticoat ; Or what you will command me will I do , So well I know my duty to my elders . Of all thy suitors , here I charge thee , tell Whom thou lov'st best : see thou dissemble not . Believe me , sister , of all the men alive I never yet beheld that special face Which I could fancy more than any other . Minion , thou liest . Is't not Hortensio ? If you affect him , sister , here I swear I'll plead for you myself , but you shall have him . O ! then , belike , you fancy riches more : You will have Gremio to keep you fair . Is it for him you do envy me so ? Nay , then you jest ; and now I well perceive You have but jested with me all this while : I prithee , sister Kate , untie my hands . If that be jest , then all the rest was so . Why , how now , dame ! whence grows this insolence ? Bianca , stand aside . Poor girl ! she weeps . Go ply thy needle ; meddle not with her . For shame , thou hilding of a devilish spirit , Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee ? When did she cross thee with a bitter word ? Her silence flouts me , and I'll be reveng'd . What ! in my sight ? Bianca , get thee in . What ! will you not suffer me ? Nay , now I see She is your treasure , she must have a husband ; I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day , And , for your love to her , lead apes in hell . Talk not to me : I will go sit and weep Till I can find occasion of revenge . Was ever gentleman thus griev'd as I ? But who comes here ? Good morrow , neighbour Baptista . Good morrow , neighbour Gremio . God save you , gentlemen ! And you , good sir . Pray , have you not a daughter Call'd Katharina , fair and virtuous ? I have a daughter , sir , call'd Katharina . You are too blunt : go to it orderly . You wrong me , Signior Gremio : give me leave . I am a gentleman of Verona , sir , That , hearing of her beauty and her wit , Her affability and bashful modesty , Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour , Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house , to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard . And , for an entrance to my entertainment , I do present you with a man of mine , Cunning in music and the mathematics , To instruct her fully in those sciences , Whereof I know she is not ignorant . Accept of him , or else you do me wrong : His name is Licio , born in Mantua . You're welcome , sir ; and he , for your good sake . But for my daughter Katharine , this I know , She is not for your turn , the more my grief . I see you do not mean to part with her , Or else you like not of my company . Mistake me not ; I speak but as I find . Whence are you , sir ? what may I call your name ? Petruchio is my name ; Antonio's son ; A man well known throughout all Italy . I know him well : you are welcome for his sake . Saving your tale , Petruchio , I pray , Let us , that are poor petitioners , speak too . Backare ! you are marvellous forward . O , pardon me , Signior Gremio ; I would fain be doing . I doubt it not , sir ; but you will curse your wooing . Neighbour , this is a gift very grateful , I am sure of it . To express the like kindness myself , that have been more kindly beholding to you than any , freely give unto you this young scholar , that has been long studying at Rheims ; as cunning in Greek , Latin , and other languages , as the other in music and mathematics . His name is Cambio ; pray accept his service . A thousand thanks , Signior Gremio ; welcome , good Cambio . But , gentle sir , methinks you walk like a stranger : may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming ? Pardon me , sir , the boldness is mine own , That , being a stranger in this city here , Do make myself a suitor to your daughter , Unto Bianca , fair and virtuous . Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me , In the preferment of the eldest sister . This liberty is all that I request , That , upon knowledge of my parentage , I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo , And free access and favour as the rest : And , toward the education of your daughters , I here bestow a simple instrument , And this small packet of Greek and Latin books : If you accept them , then their worth is great . Lucentio is your name , of whence , I pray ? Of Pisa , sir ; son to Vincentio . A mighty man of Pisa ; by report I know him well : you are very welcome , sir . and you the set of books ; You shall go see your pupils presently . Holla , within ! Sirrah , lead these gentlemen To my two daughters , and then tell them both These are their tutors : bid them use them well . We will go walk a little in the orchard , And then to dinner . You are passing welcome , And so I pray you all to think yourselves . Signior Baptista , my business asketh haste , And every day I cannot come to woo . You knew my father well , and in him me , Left solely heir to all his lands and goods , Which I have better'd rather than decreas'd : Then tell me , if I get your daughter's love , What dowry shall I have with her to wife ? After my death the one half of my lands , And in possession twenty thousand crowns . And , for that dowry , I'll assure her of Her widowhood , be it that she survive me , In all my lands and leases whatsoever . Let specialties be therefore drawn between us , That covenants may be kept on either hand . Ay , when the special thing is well obtain'd , That is , her love ; for that is all in all . Why , that is nothing ; for I tell you , father , I am as peremptory as she proud-minded ; And where two raging fires meet together They do consume the thing that feeds their fury : Though little fire grows great with little wind , Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all ; So I to her , and so she yields to me ; For I am rough and woo not like a babe . Well mayst thou woo , and happy be thy speed ! But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words . Ay , to the proof ; as mountains are for winds , That shake not , though they blow perpetually . How now , my friend ! why dost thou look so pale ? For fear , I promise you , if I look pale . What , will my daughter prove a good musician ? I think she'll sooner prove a soldier : Iron may hold with her , but never lutes . Why , then thou canst not break her to the lute ? Why , no ; for she hath broke the lute to me . I did but tell her she mistook her frets , And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering ; When , with a most impatient devilish spirit , 'Frets , call you these ?' quoth she ; 'I'll fume with them ;' And , with that word , she struck me on the head , And through the instrument my pate made way ; And there I stood amazed for a while , As on a pillory , looking through the lute ; While she did call me rascal fiddler , And twangling Jack ; with twenty such vile terms As she had studied to misuse me so . Now , by the world , it is a lusty wench ! I love her ten times more than e'er I did : O ! how I long to have some chat with her ! Well , go with me , and be not so discomfited : Proceed in practice with my younger daughter ; She's apt to learn , and thankful for good turns . Signior Petruchio , will you go with us , Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you ? I pray you do ; I will attend her here , And woo her with some spirit when she comes . Say that she rail ; why then I'll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale : Say that she frown ; I'll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly wash'd with dew : Say she be mute and will not speak a word ; Then I'll commend her volubility , And say she uttereth piercing eloquence : If she do bid me pack ; I'll give her thanks , As though she bid me stay by her a week : If she deny to wed ; I'll crave the day When I shall ask the banns , and when be married . But here she comes ; and now , Petruchio , speak . Good morrow , Kate ; for that's your name , I hear . Well have you heard , but something hard of hearing : They call me Katharine that do talk of me . You lie , in faith ; for you are call'd plain Kate , And bonny Kate , and sometimes Kate the curst ; But , Kate , the prettiest Kate in Christendom ; Kate of Kate-Hall , my super-dainty Kate , For dainties are all cates : and therefore , Kate , Take this of me , Kate of my consolation ; Hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town , Thy virtues spoke of , and thy beauty sounded , Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs , Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife . Mov'd ! in good time : let him that mov'd you hither Remove you hence . I knew you at the first , You were a moveable . Why , what's a moveable ? A joint-stool . Thou hast hit it : come , sit on me . Asses are made to bear , and so are you . Women are made to bear , and so are you . No such jade as bear you , if me you mean . Alas ! good Kate , I will not burden thee ; For , knowing thee to be but young and light , Too light for such a swain as you to catch , And yet as heavy as my weight should be . Should be ! should buz ! Well ta'en , and like a buzzard . O slow-wing'd turtle ! shall a buzzard take thee ? Ay , for a turtle , as he takes a buzzard . Come , come , you wasp ; i' faith you are too angry . If I be waspish , best beware my sting . My remedy is , then , to pluck it out . Ay , if the fool could find it where it lies . Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting ? In his tail . In his tongue . Whose tongue ? Yours , if you talk of tails ; and so farewell . What ! with my tongue in your tail ? nay , come again . Good Kate , I am a gentleman . That I'll try . I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again . So may you lose your arms : If you strike me , you are no gentleman ; And if no gentleman , why then no arms . A herald , Kate ? O ! put me in thy books . What is your crest ? a coxcomb ? A combless cock , so Kate will be my hen . No cock of mine ; you crow too like a craven . Nay , come , Kate , come ; you must not look so sour . It is my fashion when I see a crab . Why , here's no crab , and therefore look not sour . There is , there is . Then show it me . Had I a glass , I would . What , you mean my face ? Well aim'd of such a young one . Now , by Saint George , I am too young for you . Yet you are wither'd . 'Tis with cares . I care not . Nay , hear you , Kate : in sooth , you 'scape not so . I chafe you , if I tarry : let me go . No , not a whit : I find you passing gentle . 'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen , And now I find report a very liar ; For thou art pleasant , gamesome , passing courteous , But slow in speech , yet sweet as spring-time flowers : Thou canst not frown , thou canst not look askance , Nor bite the lip , as angry wenches will ; Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk ; But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers , With gentle conference , soft and affable . Why does the world report that Kate doth limp ? O slanderous world ! Kate , like the hazel-twig , Is straight and slender , and as brown in hue As hazel nuts , and sweeter than the kernels . O ! let me see thee walk : thou dost not halt . Go , fool , and whom thou keep'st command . Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait ? O ! be thou Dian , and let her be Kate , And then let Kate be chaste , and Dian sportful ! Where did you study all this goodly speech ? It is extempore , from my mother-wit . A witty mother ! witless else her son . Am I not wise ? Yes ; keep you warm . Marry , so I mean , sweet Katharine , in thy bed : And therefore , setting all this chat aside , Thus in plain terms : your father hath consented That you shall be my wife ; your dowry 'greed on ; And will you , nill you , I will marry you . Now , Kate , I am a husband for your turn ; For , by this light , whereby I see thy beauty , Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well , Thou must be married to no man but me : For I am he am born to tame you , Kate ; And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates . Here comes your father : never make denial ; I must and will have Katharine to my wife . Now , Signior Petruchio , how speed you with my daughter ? How but well , sir ? how but well ? It were impossible I should speed amiss . Why , how now , daughter Katharine ! in your dumps ? Call you me daughter ? now , I promise you You have show'd a tender fatherly regard , To wish me wed to one half lunatic ; A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack , That thinks with oaths to face the matter out . Father , 'tis thus : yourself and all the world , That talk'd of her , have talk'd amiss of her : If she be curst , it is for policy , For she's not froward , but modest as the dove ; She is not hot , but temperate as the morn ; For patience she will prove a second Grissel , And Roman Lucrece for her chastity ; And to conclude , we have 'greed so well together , That upon Sunday is the wedding-day . I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first . Hark , Petruchio : she says she'll see thee hang'd first . Is this your speeding ? nay then , good night our part ! Be patient , gentlemen ; I choose her for myself : If she and I be pleas'd , what's that to you ? 'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain , being alone , That she shall still be curst in company . I tell you , 'tis incredible to believe How much she loves me : O ! the kindest Kate . She hung about my neck , and kiss on kiss She vied so fast , protesting oath on oath , That in a twink she won me to her love . O ! you are novices : 'tis a world to see , How tame , when men and women are alone , A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew . Give me thy hand , Kate : I will unto Venice To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day . Provide the feast , father , and bid the guests ; I will be sure my Katharine shall be fine . I know not what to say ; but give me your hands . God send you joy , Petruchio ! 'tis a match . Amen , say we : we will be witnesses . Amen , say we : we will be witnesses . Father , and wife , and gentlemen , adieu . I will to Venice ; Sunday comes apace : We will have rings , and things , and fine array ; And , kiss me , Kate , we will be married o' Sunday . Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly ? Faith , gentlemen , now I play a merchant's part , And venture madly on a desperate mart . 'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you : 'Twill bring you gain , or perish on the seas . The gain I seek is , quiet in the match . No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch . But now , Baptista , to your younger daughter : Now is the day we long have looked for : I am your neighbour , and was suitor first . And I am one that love Bianca more Than words can witness , or your thoughts can guess . Youngling , thou canst not love so dear as I . Greybeard , thy love doth freeze . But thine doth fry . Skipper , stand back : 'tis age that nourisheth . But youth in ladies eyes that flourisheth . Content you , gentlemen ; I'll compound this strife : 'Tis deeds must win the prize ; and he , of both , That can assure my daughter greatest dower Shall have my Bianca's love . Say , Signior Gremio , what can you assure her ? First , as you know , my house within the city Is richly furnished with plate and gold : Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands ; My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry ; In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns ; In cypress chests my arras counterpoints , Costly apparel , tents , and canopies , Fine linen , Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl , Valance of Venice gold in needle-work , Pewter and brass , and all things that belong To house or housekeeping : then , at my farm I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail , Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls , And all things answerable to this portion . Myself am struck in years , I must confess ; And if I die to-morrow , this is hers , If whilst I live she will be only mine . That 'only' came well in . Sir , list to me : I am my father's heir and only son : If I may have your daughter to my wife , I'll leave her houses three or four as good , Within rich Pisa walls , as any one Old Signior Gremio has in Padua ; Besides two thousand ducats by the year Of fruitful land , all of which shall be her jointure . What , have I pinch'd you , Signior Gremio ? Two thousand ducats by the year of land ! My land amounts not to so much in all : That she shall have ; besides an argosy That now is lying in Marseilles' road . What , have I chok'd you with an argosy ? Gremio , 'tis known my father hath no less Than three great argosies , besides two galliasses , And twelve tight galleys ; these I will assure her , And twice as much , whate'er thou offer'st next . Nay , I have offer'd all , I have no more ; And she can have no more than all I have : If you like me , she shall have me and mine . Why , then the maid is mine from all the world , By your firm promise . Gremio is out-vied . I must confess your offer is the best ; And , let your father make her the assurance , She is your own ; else , you must pardon me : If you should die before him , where's her dower ? That's but a cavil : he is old , I young . And may not young men die as well as old ? Well , gentlemen , I am thus resolv'd . On Sunday next , you know , My daughter Katharine is to be married : Now , on the Sunday following , shall Bianca Be bride to you , if you make this assurance ; If not , to Signior Gremio : And so , I take my leave , and thank you both . Adieu , good neighbour . Now I fear thee not : Sirrah young gamester , your father were a fool To give thee all , and in his waning age Set foot under thy table . Tut ! a toy ! An old Italian fox is not so kind , my boy . A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide ! Yet I have fac'd it with a card of ten . 'Tis in my head to do my master good : I see no reason , but suppos'd Lucentio Must get a father , called 'suppos'd Vincentio ;' And that's a wonder : fathers , commonly Do get their children ; but in this case of wooing , A child shall get a sire , if I fail not of my cunning . Fiddler , forbear ; you grow too forward , sir : Have you so soon forgot the entertainment Her sister Katharine welcom'd you withal ? But , wrangling pedant , this is The patroness of heavenly harmony : Then give me leave to have prerogative ; And when in music we have spent an hour , Your lecture shall have leisure for as much . Preposterous ass , that never read so far To know the cause why music was ordain'd ! Was it not to refresh the mind of man After his studies or his usual pain ? Then give me leave to read philosophy , And while I pause , serve in your harmony . Sirrah , I will not bear these braves of thine . Why , gentlemen , you do me double wrong , To strive for that which resteth in my choice . I am no breeching scholar in the schools ; I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times , But learn my lessons as I please myself . And , to cut off all strife , here sit we down : Take you your instrument , play you the whiles ; His lecture will be done ere you have tun'd . You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune ? That will be never : tune vour instrument . Where left we last ? Here , madam : Hac ibat Simois ; hic est Sigeia tellus ; Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis . Construe them . Hac ibat , as I told you before , Simois , I am Lucentio , hic est , son unto Vincentio of Pisa , Sigeia tellus , disguised thus to get your love ; Hic steterat , and that Lucentio that comes a wooing , Priami , is my man Tranio , regia , bearing my port , celsa senis , that we might beguile the old pantaloon . Madam , my instrument's in tune . Let's hear . O fie ! the treble jars . Spit in the hole , man , and tune again . Now let me see if I can construe it : Hac ibat Simois , I know you not , hic est Sigeia tellus , I trust you not ; Hic steterat Priami , take heed he hear us not , regia , presume not ; celsa senis , despair not . Madam , 'tis now in tune . All but the base . The base is right ; 'tis the base knave that jars . How fiery and forward our pedant is ! Now , for my life , the knave doth court my love : Pedascule , I'll watch you better yet . In time I may believe , yet I mistrust . Mistrust it not ; for , sure , acides Was Ajax , call'd so from his grandfather . I must believe my master ; else , I promise you , I should be arguing still upon that doubt : But let it rest . Now , Licio , to you . Good masters , take it not unkindly , pray , That I have been thus pleasant with you both . You may go walk , and give me leave a while : My lessons make no music in three parts . Are you so formal , sir ? Well , I must wait , And watch withal ; for , but I be deceiv'd , Our fine musician groweth amorous . Madam , before you touch the instrument , To learn the order of my fingering , I must begin with rudiments of art ; To teach you gamut in a briefer sort , More pleasant , pithy , and effectual , Than hath been taught by any of my trade : And there it is in writing , fairly drawn . Why , I am past my gamut long ago . Yet read the gamut of Hortensio . 'Gamut' I am , the ground of all accord , 'A re ,' to plead Hortensio's passion ; 'B mi ,' Bianca , take him for thy lord , 'C fa ut ,' that loves with all affection : 'D sol re ,' one clef , two notes have I : 'E la mi ,' show pity , or I die . Call you this gamut ? tut , I like it not : Old fashions please me best ; I am not so nice , To change true rules for odd inventions . Mistress , your father prays you leave your books , And help to dress your sister's chamber up : You know to-morrow is the wedding-day . Farewell , sweet masters both : I must be gone . Faith , mistress , then I have no cause to stay . But I have cause to pry into this pedant : Methinks he looks as though he were in love . Yet if thy thoughts , Bianca , be so humble To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale , Seize thee that list : if once I find thee ranging , Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing . Signior Lucentio , this is the 'pointed day That Katharine and Petruchio should be married , And yet we hear not of our son-in-law . What will be said ? what mockery will it be To want the bridegroom when the priest attends To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage ! What says Lucentio to this shame of ours ? No shame but mine : I must , forsooth , be forc'd To give my hand oppos'd against my heart Unto a mad-brain rudesby , full of spleen ; Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure . I told you , I , he was a frantic fool , Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour ; And to be noted for a merry man , He'll woo a thousand , 'point the day of marriage , Make friends invite , and proclaim the banns ; Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd . Now must the world point at poor Katharine , And say , 'Lo ! there is mad Petruchio's wife , If it would please him come and marry her .' Patience , good Katharine , and Baptista too . Upon my life , Petruchio means but well , Whatever fortune stays him from his word : Though he be blunt , I know him passing wise ; Though he be merry , yet withal he's honest . Would Katharine had never seen him though ! Go , girl : I cannot blame thee now to weep , For such an injury would vex a very saint , Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour . Master , master ! news ! old news , and such news as you never heard of ! Is it new and old too ? how may that be ? Why , is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming ? Is he come ? Why , no , sir . What then ? He is coming . When will he be here ? When he stands where I am and sees you there . But , say , what to thine old news ? Why , Petruchio is coming , in a new hat and an old jerkin ; a pair of old breeches thrice turned ; a pair of boots that have been candle-cases , one buckled , another laced ; an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town-armoury , with a broken hilt , and chapeless ; with two broken points : his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred ; besides , possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine ; troubled with the lampass , infected with the fashions , full of windgalls , sped with spavins , rayed with the yellows , past cure of the fives , stark spoiled with the staggers , begnawn with the bots , swayed in the back , and shoulder-shotten ; near-legged before , and with a half-checked bit , and a head-stall of sheep's leather , which , being restrained to keep him from stumbling , hath been often burst and now repaired with knots ; one girth six times pieced , and a woman's crupper of velure , which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs , and here and there pieced with packthread . Who comes with him ? O , sir ! his lackey , for all the world caparisoned like the horse ; with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other , gartered with a red and blue list ; an old hat , and the 'humour of forty fancies' pricked in't for a feather : a monster , a very monster in apparel , and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman's lackey . 'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion ; Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd . I am glad he is come , howsoe'er he comes . Why , sir , he comes not . Didst thou not say he comes ? Who ? that Petruchio came ? Ay , that Petruchio came . No , sir ; I say his horse comes , with him on his back . Why , that's all one . Nay , by Saint Jamy , I hold you a penny , A horse and a man Is more than one , And yet not many . Come , where be these gallants ? who is at home ? You are welcome , sir . And yet I come not well . And yet you halt not . Not so well apparell'd As I wish you were . Were it better , I should rush in thus . But where is Kate ? where is my lovely bride ? How does my father ? Gentles , methinks you frown : And wherefore gaze this goodly company , As if they saw some wondrous monument , Some comet , or unusual prodigy ? Why , sir , you know this is your weddingday : First were we sad , fearing you would not come ; Now sadder , that you come so unprovided . Fie ! doff this habit , shame to your estate , An eye-sore to our solemn festival . And tell us what occasion of import Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife , And sent you hither so unlike yourself ? Tedious it were to tell , and harsh to hear : Sufficeth , I am come to keep my word , Though in some part enforced to digress ; Which , at more leisure , I will so excuse As you shall well be satisfied withal . But where is Kate ? I stay too long from her : The morning wears , 'tis time we were at church . See not your bride in these unreverent robes : Go to my chamber ; put on clothes of mine . Not I , believe me : thus I'll visit her . But thus , I trust , you will not marry her . Good sooth , even thus ; therefore ha' done with words : To me she's married , not unto my clothes . Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements , 'Twere well for Kate and better for myself . But what a fool am I to chat with you When I should bid good morrow to my bride , And seal the title with a lovely kiss ! He hath some meaning in his mad attire . We will persuade him , be it possible , To put on better ere he go to church . I'll after him , and see the event of this . But to her love concerneth us to add Her father's liking : which to bring to pass , As I before imparted to your worship , I am to get a man ,whate'er he be It skills not much , we'll fit him to our turn , And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa , And make assurance here in Padua , Of greater sums than I have promised . So shall you quietly enjoy your hope , And marry sweet Bianca with consent . Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly , 'Twere good , methinks , to steal our marriage ; Which once perform'd , let all the world say no , I'll keep mine own , despite of all the world . That by degrees we mean to look into , And watch our vantage in this business . We'll over-reach the greybeard , Gremio , The narrow-prying father , Minola , The quaint musician , amorous Licio ; All for my master's sake , Lucentio . Signior Gremio , came you from the church ? As willingly as e'er I came from school . And is the bride and bridegroom coming home ? A bridegroom say you ? 'Tis a groom indeed , A grumbling groom , and that the girl shall find . Curster than she ? why , 'tis impossible . Why , he's a devil , a devil , a very fiend . Why , she's a devil , a devil , the devil's dam . Tut ! she's a lamb , a dove , a fool to him . I'll tell you , Sir Lucentio : when the priest Should ask , if Katharine should be his wife , 'Ay , by gogs-wouns !' quoth he ; and swore so loud , That , all amaz'd , the priest let fall the book ; And , as he stoop'd again to take it up , The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff That down fell priest and book and book and priest : 'Now take them up ,' quoth he , 'if any list .' What said the wench when he arose again ? Trembled and shook ; for why he stampt and swore , As if the vicar meant to cozen him . But after many ceremonies done , He calls for wine : 'A health !' quoth he ; as if He had been aboard , carousing to his mates After a storm ; quaff'd off the muscadel , And threw the sops all in the sexton's face ; Having no other reason But that his beard grew thin and hungerly , And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking . This done , he took the bride about the neck , And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo : And I , seeing this , came thence for very shame ; And after me , I know , the rout is coming . Such a mad marriage never was before . Hark , hark ! I hear the minstrels play . Gentlemen and friends , I thank you for your pains : I know you think to dine with me to-day , And have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer ; But so it is , my haste doth call me hence , And therefore here I mean to take my leave . Is't possible you will away to-night ? I must away to-day , before night come . Make it no wonder : if you knew my business , You would entreat me rather go than stay . And , honest company , I thank you all , That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient , sweet , and virtuous wife . Dine with my father , drink a health to me , For I must hence ; and farewell to you all . Let us entreat you stay till after dinner . It may not be . Let me entreat you . It cannot be . Let me entreat you . I am content . Are you content to stay ? I am content you shall entreat me stay , But yet not stay , entreat me how you can . Now , if you love me , stay . Grumio , my horse ! Ay , sir , they be ready : the oats have eaten the horses . Nay , then , Do what thou canst , I will not go to-day ; No , nor to-morrow , nor till I please myself , The door is open , sir , there lies your way ; You may be jogging whiles your boots are green ; For me , I'll not be gone till I please myself . 'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom , That take it on you at the first so roundly . O Kate ! content thee : prithee , be not angry . I will be angry : what hast thou to do ? Father , be quiet ; he shall stay my leisure . Ay , marry , sir , now it begins to work . Gentlemen , forward to the bridal dinner : I see a woman may be made a fool , If she had not a spirit to resist . They shall go forward , Kate , at thy command . Obey the bride , you that attend on her ; Go to the feast , revel and domineer , Carouse full measure to her maidenhead , Be mad and merry , or go hang yourselves : But for my bonny Kate , she must with me . Nay , look not big , nor stamp , nor stare , nor fret ; I will be master of what is mine own . She is my goods , my chattels ; she is my house , My household stuff , my field , my barn , My horse , my ox , my ass , my anything ; And here she stands , touch her whoever dare ; I'll bring mine action on the proudest he That stops my way in Padua . Grumio , Draw forth thy weapon , we're beset with thieves ; Rescue thy mistress , if thou be a man . Fear not , sweet wench ; they shall not touch thee , Kate : I'll buckler thee against a million . Nay , let them go , a couple of quiet ones . Went they not quickly I should die with laughing . Of all mad matches never was the like . Mistress , what's your opinion of your sister ? That , being mad herself , she's madly mated . I warrant him , Petruchio is Kated . Neighbours and friends , though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table , You know there wants no junkets at the feast . Lucentio , you shall supply the bridegroom's place , And let Bianca take her sister's room . Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it ? She shall , Lucentio . Come , gentlemen , let's go . Fie , fie , on all tired jades , on all mad masters , and all foul ways ! Was ever man so beaten ? was ever man so rayed ? was ever man so weary ? I am sent before to make a fire , and they are coming after to warm them . Now , were not I a little pot and soon hot , my very lips might freeze to my teeth , my tongue to the roof of my mouth , my heart in my belly , ere I should come by a fire to thaw me ; but I , with blowing the fire , shall warm myself ; for , considering the weather , a taller man than I will take cold . Holla , ho ! Curtis . Who is that calls so coldly ? A piece of ice : if thou doubt it , thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck . A fire , good Curtis . Is my master and his wife coming , Grumio ? O ! ay , Curtis , ay ; and therefore fire , fire ; cast on no water . Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported ? She was , good Curtis , before this frost ; but , thou knowest , winter tames man , woman , and beast ; for it hath tamed my old master , and my new mistress , and myself , fellow Curtis . Away , you three-inch-fool ! I am no beast . Am I but three inches ? why , thy horn is a foot ; and so long am I at the least . But wilt thou make a fire , or shall I complain on thee to our mistress , whose hand ,she being now at hand ,thou shalt soon feel , to thy cold comfort , for being slow in thy hot office ? I prithee , good Grumio , tell me , how goes the world ? A cold world , Curtis , in every office but thine ; and therefore , fire . Do thy duty , and have thy duty , for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death . There's fire ready ; and therefore , good Grumio , the news ? Why , 'Jack , boy ! ho , boy !' and as much news as thou wilt . Come , you are so full of cony-catching . Why therefore fire : for I have caught extreme cold . Where's the cook ? is supper ready , the house trimmed , rushes strewed , cobwebs swept ; the serving-men in their new fustian , their white stockings , and every officer his wedding-garment on ? Be the Jacks fair within , the Jills fair without , and carpets laid , and everything in order ? All ready ; and therefore , I pray thee , news ? First , know , my horse is tired ; my master and mistress fallen out . How ? Out of their saddles into the dirt ; and thereby hangs a tale . Let's ha't , good Grumio . Lend thine ear . Here . There . This is to feel a tale , not to hear a tale . And therefore it is called a sensible tale ; and this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech listening . Now I begin : Imprimis , we came down a foul hill , my master riding behind my mistress , Both of one horse ? What's that to thee ? Why , a horse . Tell thou the tale : but hadst thou not crossed me thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell , and she under her horse ; thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place , how she was bemoiled : how he left her with the horse upon her ; how he beat me because her horse stumbled ; how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me : how he swore ; how she prayed , that never prayed before ; how I cried ; how the horses ran away ; how her bridle was burst ; how I lost my crupper ; with many things of worthy memory , which now shall die in oblivion , and thou return unexperienced to thy grave . By this reckoning he is more shrew than she . Ay ; and that , thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home . But what talk I of this ? Call forth Nathaniel , Joseph , Nicholas , Philip , Walter , Sugarsop , and the rest : let their heads be sleekly combed , their blue coats brushed , and their garters of an indifferent knit : let them curtsy with their left legs , and not presume to touch a hair of my master's horsetail till they kiss their hands . Are they all ready ? They are . Call them forth . Do you hear ? ho ! you must meet my master to countenance my mistress . Why , she hath a face of her own . Who knows not that ? Thou , it seems , that callest for company to countenance her . I call them forth to credit her . Why , she comes to borrow nothing of them . Welcome home , Grumio ! How now , Grumio ? What , Grumio ! Fellow Grumio ! How now , old lad ! Welcome , you ; how now , you ; what , you ; fellow , you ; and thus much for greeting . Now , my spruce companions , is all ready , and all things neat ? All things is ready . How near is our master ? E'en at hand , alighted by this ; and therefore be not ,Cock's passion , silence ! I hear my master . Where be these knaves ? What ! no man at door To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse ? Where is Nathaniel , Gregory , Philip ? Here , here , sir ; here , sir . Here , sir ! here , sir ! here , sir ! here , sir ! You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms ! What , no attendance ? no regard ? no duty ? Where is the foolish knave I sent before ? Here , sir ; as foolish as I was before . You peasant swain ! you whoreson malt-horse drudge ! Did I not bid thee meet me in the park , And bring along these rascal knaves with thee ? Nathaniel's coat , sir , was not fully made , And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel , There was no link to colour Peter's hat , And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing , There were none fine but Adam , Ralph , and Gregory ; The rest were ragged , old , and beggarly ; Yet , as they are , here are they come to meet you . Go , rascals , go , and fetch my supper in . Where is the life that late I led ? Where are those ? Sit down , Kate , and welcome . Soud , soud , soud , soud ! Why , when , I say ?Nay , good sweet Kate , be merry . Off with my boots , you rogues ! you villains ! When ? It was the friar of orders grey , As he forth walked on his way : Out , you rogue ! you pluck my foot awry : Take that , and mend the plucking off the other . Be merry , Kate . Some water , here ; what , ho ! Where's my spaniel Troilus ? Sirrah , get you hence And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither : One , Kate , that you must kiss , and be acquainted with . Where are my slippers ? Shall I have some water ? Come , Kate , and wash , and welcome heartily . You whoreson villain ! will you let it fall ? Patience , I pray you ; 'twas a fault unwilling . A whoreson , beetle-headed , flap-ear'd knave ! Come , Kate , sit down ; I know you have a stomach . Will you give thanks , sweet Kate , or else shall I ? What's this ? mutton ? Ay . Who brought it ?
