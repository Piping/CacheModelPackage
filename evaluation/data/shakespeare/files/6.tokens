You do not meet a man but frowns ; our bloods No more obey the heavens than our courtiers Still seem as does the king . But what's the matter ? His daughter , and the heir of 's kingdom , whom He purpos'd to his wife's sole son ,a widow That late he married ,hath referr'd herself Unto a poor but worthy gentleman . She's wedded ; Her husband banish'd , she imprison'd : all Is outward sorrow , though I think the king Be touch'd at very heart . None but the king ? He that hath lost her too ; so is the queen , That most desir'd the match ; but not a courtier , Although they wear their faces to the bent Of the king's looks , hath a heart that is not Glad at the thing they scowl at . And why so ? He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing Too bad for bad report ; and he that hath her , I mean that married her , alack ! good man ! And therefore banish'd is a creature such As , to seek through the regions of the earth For one his like , there would be something failing In him that should compare . I do not think So fair an outward and such stuff within Endows a man but he . You speak him far . I do extend him , sir , within himself , Crush him together rather than unfold His measure duly . What's his name and birth ? I cannot delve him to the root : his father Was called Sicilius , who did join his honour Against the Romans with Cassibelan , But had his titles by Tenantius whom He serv'd with glory and admir'd success , So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus ; And had , besides this gentleman in question , Two other sons , who in the wars o' the time Died with their swords in hand ; for which their father Then old and fond of issue took such sorrow That he quit being , and his gentle lady , Big of this gentleman , our theme , deceas'd As he was born . The king , he takes the babe To his protection ; calls him Posthumus Leonatus ; Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber , Puts to him all the learnings that his time Could make him the receiver of ; which he took , As we do air , fast as 'twas minister'd , And in's spring became a harvest ; liv'd in court , Which rare it is to do most prais'd , most lov'd ; A sample to the youngest , to the more mature A glass that feated them , and to the graver A child that guided dotards ; to his mistress , For whom he now is banish'd , her own price Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue ; By her election may be truly read What kind of man he is . I honour him , Even out of your report . But pray you , tell me , Is she sole child to the king ? His only child . He had twosons ,if this be worth your hearing , Mark it ,the eldest of them at three years old , I' the swathing clothes the other , from their nursery Were stol'n ; and to this hour no guess in knowledge Which way they went . How long is this ago ? Some twenty years . That a king's children should be so convey'd , So slackly guarded , and the search so slow , That could not trace them ! Howsoe'er 'tis strange , Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at , Yet is it true , sir . I do well believe you . We must forbear . Here comes the gentleman , The queen , and princess . No , be assur'd you shall not find me , daughter , After the slander of most step-mothers , Evil-ey'd unto you ; you're my prisoner , but Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys That lock up your restraint . For you , Posthumus , So soon as I can win the offended king , I will be known your advocate ; marry , yet The fire of rage is in him , and 'twere good You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience Your wisdom may inform you . Please your highness , I will from hence to-day . You know the peril : I'll fetch a turn about the garden , pitying The pangs of barr'd affections , though the king Hath charg'd you should not speak together .
