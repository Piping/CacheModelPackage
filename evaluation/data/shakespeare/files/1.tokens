You spotted snakes with double tongue , Thorny hedge-hogs , be not seen ; Newts , and blind-worms , do no wrong ; Come not near our fairy queen . Philomel , with melody , Sing in our sweet lullaby : Lulla , lulla , lullaby ; lulla , lulla , lullaby : Never harm , Nor spell , nor charm , Come our lovely lady nigh ; So , good night , with lullaby .
