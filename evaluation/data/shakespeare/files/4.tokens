O ! pray , pray , pray . Manka revania dulche . Oscorbidulchos volivorco . The general is content to spare thee yet ; And , hoodwink'd as thou art , will lead thee on To gather from thee : haply thou may'st inform Something to save thy life . O ! let me live , And all the secrets of our camp I'll show , Their force , their purposes ; nay , I'll speak that Which you will wonder at . But wilt thou faithfully ? If I do not , damn me . Acordo linta . Come on ; thou art granted space . Go , tell the Count Rousillon , and my brother , We have caught the woodcock , and will keep him muffled Till we do hear from them . Captain , I will . A' will betray us all unto ourselves : Inform on that . So I will , sir . Till then , I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd . They told me that your name was Fontibell . No , my good lord , Diana . Titled goddess ; And worth it , with addition ! But , fair soul , In your fine frame hath love no quality ? If the quick fire of youth light not your mind , You are no maiden , but a monument : When you are dead , you should be such a one As you are now , for you are cold and stern ; And now you should be as your mother was When your sweet self was got . She then was honest . So should you be . No : My mother did but duty ; such , my lord , As you owe to your wife . No more o' that ! I prithee do not strive against my vows . I was compell'd to her ; but I love thee By love's own sweet constraint , and will for ever Do thee all rights of service . Ay , so you serve us Till we serve you ; but when you have our roses , You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves And mock us with our bareness . How have I sworn ! 'Tis not the many oaths that make the truth , But the plain single vow that is vow'd true . What is not holy , that we swear not by , But take the Highest to witness : then , pray you , tell me , If I should swear by God's great attributes I lov'd you dearly , would you believe my oaths , When I did love you ill ? this has no holding , To swear by him whom I protest to love , That I will work against him : therefore your oaths Are words and poor conditions , but unseal'd ; At least in my opinion . Change it , change it . Be not so holy-cruel : love is holy ; And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts That you do charge men with . Stand no more off , But give thyself unto my sick desires , Who then recover : say thou art mine , and ever My love as it begins shall so persever . I see that men make ropes in such a scarr That we'll forsake ourselves . Give me that ring . I'll lend it thee , my dear ; but have no power To give it from me . Will you not , my lord ? It is an honour 'longing to our house , Bequeathed down from many ancestors , Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world In me to lose . Mine honour's such a ring : My chastity's the jewel of our house , Bequeathed down from many ancestors , Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world In me to lose . Thus your own proper wisdom Brings in the champion honour on my part Against your vain assault . Here , take my ring : My house , mine honour , yea , my life , be thine , And I'll be bid by thee . When midnight comes , knock at my chamber-window : I'll order take my mother shall not hear . Now will I charge you in the band of truth , When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed , Remain there but an hour , nor speak to me . My reasons are most strong ; and you shall know them When back again this ring shall be deliver'd : And on your finger in the night I'll put Another ring , that what in time proceeds May token to the future our past deeds . Adieu , till then ; then , fail not . You have won A wife of me , though there my hope be done . A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee . For which live long to thank both heaven and me ! You may so in the end . My mother told me just how he would woo As if she sat in 's heart ; she says all men Have the like oaths : he had sworn to marry me When his wife's dead ; therefore I'll lie with him When I am buried . Since Frenchmen are so braid , Marry that will , I live and die a maid : Only in this disguise I think't no sin To cozen him that would unjustly win . You have not given him his mother's letter ? I have delivered it an hour since : there is something in't that stings his nature , for on the reading it he changed almost into another man . He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady . Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king , who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him . I will tell you a thing , but you shall let it dwell darkly with you . When you have spoken it , 'tis dead , and I am the grave of it . He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence , of a most chaste renown ; and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour : he hath given her his monumental ring , and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition . Now , God delay our rebellion ! as we are ourselves , what things are we ! Merely our own traitors : and as in the common course of all treasons , we still see them reveal themselves , till they attain to their abhorred ends , so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility , in his proper stream o'erflows himself . Is it not most damnable in us , to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents ? We shall not then have his company to-night ? Not till after midnight , for he is dieted to his hour . That approaches apace : I would gladly have him see his company anatomized , that he might take a measure of his own judgments , wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit . We will not meddle with him till he come , for his presence must be the whip of the other . In the meantime what near you of these wars ? I hear there is an overture of peace . Nay , I assure you , a peace concluded . What will Count Rousillon do then ? will he travel higher , or return again into France ? I perceive by this demand , you are not altogether of his council . Let it be forbid , sir ; so should I be a great deal of his act . Sir , his wife some two months since fled from his house : her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand ; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished ; and , there residing , the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief ; in fine , made a groan of her last breath , and now she sings in heaven . How is this justified ? The stronger part of it by her own letters , which make her story true , even to the point of her death : her death itself , which could not be her office to say is come , was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place . Hath the count all this intelligence ? Ay , and the particular confirmations , point from point , to the full arming of the verity . I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this . How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses ! And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears ! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample . The web of our life is of a mingled yarn , good and ill together : our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not ; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues . How now ! where's your master ? He met the duke in the street , sir , of whom he hath taken a solemn leave : his lordship will next morning for France . The duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king . They shall be no more than needful there , if they were more than they can commend . They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness . Here's his lordship now . How now , my lord ! is't not after midnight ? I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses , a month's length a-piece , by an abstract of success : I have conge'd with the duke , done my adieu with his nearest , buried a wife , mourned for her , writ to my lady mother I am returning , entertained my convoy ; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs : the last was the greatest , but that I have not ended yet . If the business be of any difficulty , and this morning your departure hence , it requires haste of your lordship . I mean , the business is not ended , as fearing to hear of it hereafter . But shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier ? Come , bring forth this counterfeit model : he has deceived me , like a double-meaning prophesier . Bring him forth . Has sat i' the stocks all night , poor gallant knave . No matter ; his heels have deserved it , in usurping his spurs so long . How does he carry himself ? I have told your lordship already , the stocks carry him . But to answer you as you would be understood ; he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk : he hath confessed himself to Morgan ,whom he supposes to be a friar ,from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' the stocks : and what think you he hath confessed ? Nothing of me , has a' ? His confession is taken , and it shall be read to his face : if your lordship be in't , as I believe you are , you must have the patience to hear it . A plague upon him ! muffled ! he can say nothing of me : hush ! hush ! Hoodman comes ! Porto tartarossa . He calls for the tortures : what will you say without 'em ? I will confess what I know without constraint : if ye pinch me like a pasty , I can say no more . Bosko chimurcho . Boblibindo chicurmurco . You are a merciful general . Our general bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note . And truly , as I hope to live . First , demand of him how many horse the duke is strong . What say you to that ? Five or six thousand ; but very weak and unserviceable : the troops are all scattered , and the commanders very poor rogues , upon my reputation and credit , and as I hope to live . Shall I set down your answer so ? Do : I'll take the sacrament on't , how and which way you will . All's one to him . What a past-saving slave is this ! You are deceived , my lord : this is Monsieur Parolles , the gallant militarist ,that was his own phrase ,that had the whole theorick of war in the knot of his scarf , and the practice in the chape of his dagger . I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean ; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly . Well , that's set down . Five or six thousand horse , I said ,I will say true ,or thereabouts , set down , for I'll speak truth . He's very near the truth in this . But I con him no thanks for't , in the nature he delivers it . Poor rogues , I pray you , say . Well , that's set down . I humbly thank you , sir . A truth's a truth ; the rogues are marvellous poor . Demand of him , of what strength they are a-foot . What say you to that ? By my troth , sir , if I were to live this present hour , I will tell true . Let me see : Spurio , a hundred and fifty ; Sebastian , so many ; Corambus , so many ; Jaques , so many ; Guiltian , Cosmo , Lodowick , and Gratii , two hundred fifty each ; mine own company , Chitopher , Vaumond , Bentii , two hundred fifty each : so that the muster-file , rotten and sound , upon my life , amounts not to fifteen thousand poll ; half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks , lest they shake themselves to pieces . What shall be done to him ? Nothing , but let him have thanks . Demand of him my condition , and what credit I have with the duke . Well , that's set down . You shall demand of him , whether one Captain Dumain be i' the camp , a Frenchman ; what his reputation is with the duke ; what his valour , honesty , and expertness in wars ; or whether he thinks it were not possible , with well-weighing sums of gold , to corrupt him to a revolt . What say you to this ? what do you know of it ? I beseech you , let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories : demand them singly . Do you know this Captain Dumain ? I know him : a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris , from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's fool with child ; a dumb innocent , that could not say him nay . Nay , by your leave , hold your hands ; though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls . Well , is this captain in the Duke of Florence's camp ? Upon my knowledge he is , and lousy . Nay , look not so upon me ; we shall hear of your lordship anon . What is his reputation with the duke ? The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine , and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' the band : I think I have his letter in my pocket . Marry , we'll search . In good sadness , I do not know : either it is there , or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters in my tent . Here 'tis ; here's a paper ; shall I read it to you ? I do not know if it be it or no . Our interpreter does it well . Excellently . Dian , the count's a fool , and full of gold That is not the duke's letter , sir ; that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence , one Diana , to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon , a foolish idle boy , but for all that very ruttish . I pray you , sir , put it up again . Nay , I'll read it first , by your favour . My meaning in't , I protest , was very honest in the behalf of the maid ; for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy , who is a whale to virginity , and devours up all the fry it finds . Damnable both-sides rogue ! When he swears oaths , bid him drop gold , and take it ; After he scores , he never pays the score : Half won is match well made ; match , and well make it ; He ne'er pays after-debts ; take it before , And say a soldier , Dian , told thee this , Men are to mell with , boys are not to kiss ; For count of this , the count's a fool , I know it , Who pays before , but not when he does owe it . Thine , as he vow'd to thee in thine ear , He shall be whipped through the army with this rime in's forehead . This is your devoted friend , sir ; the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier . I could endure anything before but a cat , and now he's a cat to me . I perceive , sir , by our general's looks , we shall be fain to hang you . My life , sir , in any case ! not that I am afraid to die ; but that , my offences being many , I would repent out the remainder of nature . Let me live , sir , in a dungeon , i' the stocks , or anywhere , so I may live . We'll see what may be done , so you confess freely : therefore , once more to this Captain Dumain . You have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour : what is his honesty ? He will steal , sir , an egg out of a cloister ; for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus ; he professes not keeping of oaths ; in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules ; he will lie , sir , with such volubility , that you would think truth were a fool ; drunkenness is his best virtue , for he will be swine-drunk , and in his sleep he does little harm , save to his bed-clothes about him ; but they know his conditions , and lay him in straw . I have but little more to say , sir , of his honesty : he has everything that an honest man should not have ; what an honest man should have , he has nothing . I begin to love him for this . For this description of thine honesty ? A pox upon him for me ! he is more and more a cat . What say you to his expertness in war ? Faith , sir , he has led the drum before the English tragedians ,to belie him I will not ,and more of his soldiership I know not ; except , in that country , he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile-end , to instruct for the doubling of files : I would do the man what honour I can , but of this I am not certain . He hath out-villained villany so far , that the rarity redeems him . A pox on him ! he's a cat still . His qualities being at this poor price , I need not ask you , if gold will corrupt him to revolt . Sir , for a cardecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation , the inheritance of it ; and cut the entail from all remainders , and a perpetual succession for it perpetually . What's his brother , the other Captain Dumain ? Why does he ask him or me ? What's he ? E'en a crow o' the same nest ; not altogether so great as the first in goodness , but greater a great deal in evil . He excels his brother for a coward , yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is . In a retreat he out-runs any lackey ; marry , in coming on he has the cramp . If your life be saved , will you undertake to betray the Florentine ? Ay , and the captain of his horse , Count Rousillon . I'll whisper with the general , and know his pleasure . I'll no more drumming ; a plague of all drums ! Only to seem to deserve well , and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count , have I run into this danger . Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken ? There is no remedy , sir , but you must die . The general says , you , that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army , and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held , can serve the world for no honest use ; therefore you must die . Come , headsman , off with his head . O Lord , sir , let me live , or let me see my death ! That shall you , and take your leave of all your friends . So , look about you : know you any here ? Good morrow , noble captain . God bless you , Captain Parolles . God save you , noble captain . Captain , what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu ? I am for France . Good captain , will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon ? an I were not a very coward I'd compel it of you ; but fare you well . You are undone , captain ; all but your scarf ; that has a knot on't yet . Who cannot be crushed with a plot ? If you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame , you might begin an impudent nation . Fare ye well , sir ; I am for France too : we shall speak of you there . Yet am I thankful : if my heart were great 'Twould burst at this . Captain I'll be no more ; But I will eat and drink , and sleep as soft As captain shall : simply the thing I am Shall make me live . Who knows himself a braggart , Let him fear this ; for it will come to pass That every braggart shall be found an ass . Rust , sword ! cool , blushes ! and Parolles , live Safest in shame ! being fool'd , by foolery thrive ! There's place and means for every man alive . I'll after them . That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you , One of the greatest in the Christian world Shall be my surety ; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful , Ere I can perfect mine intents , to kneel . Time was I did him a desired office , Dear almost as his life ; which gratitude Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth , And answer , thanks . I duly am inform'd His Grace is at Marseilles ; to which place We have convenient convoy . You must know , I am supposed dead : the army breaking , My husband hies him home ; where , heaven aiding , And by the leave of my good lord the king , We'll be before our welcome . Gentle madam , You never had a servant to whose trust Your business was more welcome . Nor you , mistress , Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour To recompense your love . Doubt not but heaven Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower , As it hath fated her to be my motive And helper to a husband . But , O strange men ! That can such sweet use make of what they hate , When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts Defiles the pitchy night : so lust doth play With what it loathes for that which is away . But more of this hereafter . You , Diana , Under my poor instructions yet must suffer Something in my behalf . Let death and honesty Go with your impositions , I am yours Upon your will to suffer . Yet , I pray you : But with the word the time will bring on summer , When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns , And be as sweet as sharp . We must away ; Our waggon is prepar'd , and time revives us : All's well that ends well : still the fine's the crown ; Whate'er the course , the end is the renown . No , no , no ; your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there , whose villanous saffron would have made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in his colour : your daughter-in-law had been alive at this hour , and your son here at home , more advanced by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of . I would I had not known him ; it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating . If she had partaken of my flesh , and cost me the dearest groans of a mother , I could not have owed her a more rooted love . 'Twas a good lady , 'twas a good lady : we may pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another herb . Indeed , sir , she was the sweet-marjoram of the salad , or , rather the herb of grace . They are not salad-herbs , you knave ; they are nose-herbs . I am no great Nebuchadnezzar , sir ; I have not much skill in grass . Whether dost thou profess thyself , a knave , or a fool ? A fool , sir , at a woman's service , and a knave at a man's . Your distinction ? I would cozen the man of his wife , and do his service . So you were a knave at his service , indeed . And I would give his wife my bauble , sir , to do her service . I will subscribe for thee , thou art both knave and fool . At your service . No , no , no . Why , sir , if I cannot serve you , I can serve as great a prince as you are . Who's that ? a Frenchman ? Faith , sir , a' has an English name ; but his phisnomy is more hotter in France than there . What prince is that ? The black prince , sir ; alias , the prince of darkness ; alias , the devil . Hold thee , there's my purse . I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of : serve him still . I am a woodland fellow , sir , that always loved a great fire ; and the master I speak of , ever keeps a good fire . But , sure , he is the prince of the world ; let his nobility remain in's court . I am for the house with the narrow gate , which I take to be too little for pomp to enter : some that humble themselves may ; but the many will be too chill and tender , and they'll be for the flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire . Go thy ways , I begin to be aweary of thee ; and I tell thee so before , because I would not fall out with thee . Go thy ways : let my horses be well looked to , without any tricks . If I put any tricks upon 'em , sir , they shall be jade's tricks , which are their own right by the law of nature . A shrewd knave and an unhappy . So he is . My lord that's gone made himself much sport out of him : by his authority he remains here , which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness ; and , indeed , he has no pace , but runs where he will . I like him well ; 'tis not amiss . And I was about to tell you , since I heard of the good lady's death , and that my lord your son was upon his return home , I moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter ; which , in the minority of them both , his majesty , out of a self-gracious remembrance , did first propose . His highness hath promised me to do it ; and to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son , there is no fitter matter . How does your ladyship like it ? With very much content , my lord ; and I wish it happily effected . His highness comes post from Marseilles , of as able body as when he numbered thirty : he will be here to-morrow , or I am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom failed . It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die . I have letters that my son will be here to-night : I shall beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet together . Madam , I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted . You need but plead your honourable privilege . Lady , of that I have made a bold charter ; but I thank my God it holds yet . O madam ! yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet on's face : whether there be a scar under it or no , the velvet knows ; but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet . His left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half , but his right cheek is worn bare . A scar nobly got , or a noble scar , is a good livery of honour ; so belike is that . But it is your carbonadoed face . Let us go see your son , I pray you : I long to talk with the young noble soldier . Faith , there's a dozen of 'em , with delicate fine hats and most courteous feathers , which bow the head and nod at every man . But this exceeding posting , day and night , Must wear your spirits low ; we cannot help it : But since you have made the days and nights as one , To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs , Be bold you do so grow in my requital As nothing can unroot you . In happy time ; This man may help me to his majesty's ear , If he would spend his power . God save you , sir . And you . Sir , I have seen you in the court of France . I have been sometimes there . I do presume , sir , that you are not fallen From the report that goes upon your goodness ; And therefore , goaded with most sharp occasions , Which lay nice manners by , I put you to The use of your own virtues , for the which I shall continue thankful . What's your will ? That it will please you To give this poor petition to the king , And aid me with that store of power you have To come into his presence . The king's not here . Not here , sir ! Not , indeed : He hence remov'd last night , and with more haste Than is his use . Lord , how we lose our pains ! All's well that ends well yet , Though time seems so adverse and means unfit . I do beseech you , whither is he gone ? Marry , as I take it , to Rousillon ; Whither I am going . I do beseech you , sir , Since you are like to see the king before me , Commend the paper to his gracious hand ; Which I presume shall render you no blame But rather make you thank your pains for it . I will come after you with what good speed Our means will make us means . This I'll do for you . And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd , Whate'er falls more . We must to horse again : Go , go , provide . Good Monsieur Lavache , give my Lord Lafeu this letter . I have ere now , sir , been better known to you , when I have held familiarity with fresher clothes ; but I am now , sir , muddied in Fortune's mood , and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure . Truly , Fortune's displeasure is but sluttish if it smell so strongly as thou speakest of : I will henceforth eat no fish of Fortune's buttering . Prithee , allow the wind . Nay , you need not to stop your nose , sir : I spake but by a metaphor . Indeed , sir , if your metaphor stink , I will stop my nose ; or against any man's metaphor . Prithee , get thee further . Pray you , sir , deliver me this paper . Foh ! prithee , stand away : a paper from Fortune's close-stool to give to a nobleman ! Look , here he comes himself . Here is a purr of Fortune's , sir , or of Fortune's cat but not a musk-cat that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure , and , as he says , is muddied withal . Pray you , sir , use the carp as you may , for he looks like a poor , decayed , ingenious , foolish , rascally knave . I do pity his distress in my similes of comfort , and leave him to your lordship . My lord , I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratched . And what would you have me to do ? 'tis too late to pare her nails now . Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune that she should scratch you , who of herself is a good lady , and would not have knaves thrive long under her ? There's a cardecu for you . Let the justices make you and Fortune friends ; I am for other business . I beseech your honour to hear me one single word . You beg a single penny more : come , you shall ha't ; save your word . My name , my good lord , is Parolles . You beg more than one word then . Cox my passion ! give me your hand . How does your drum ? O , my good lord ! you were the first that found me . Was I , in sooth ? and I was the first that lost thee . It lies in you , my lord , to bring me in some grace , for you did bring me out . Out upon thee , knave ! dost thou put upon me at once both the office of God and the devil ? one brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out . The king's coming ; I know by his trumpets . Sirrah , inquire further after me ; I had talk of you last night : though you are a fool and a knave , you shall eat : go to , follow . I praise God for you . We lost a jewel of her , and our esteem Was made much poorer by it : but your son , As mad in folly , lack'd the sense to know Her estimation home . 'Tis past , my liege ; And I beseech your majesty to make it Natural rebellion , done i' the blaze of youth ; When oil and fire , too strong for reason's force , O'erbears it and burns on . My honour'd lady , I have forgiven and forgotten all , Though my revenges were high bent upon him , And watch'd the time to shoot . This I must say , But first I beg my pardon ,the young lord Did to his majesty , his mother , and his lady , Offence of mighty note , but to himself The greatest wrong of all : he lost a wife Whose beauty did astonish the survey Of richest eyes , whose words all ears took captive , Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve Humbly call'd mistress . Praising what is lost Makes the remembrance dear . Well , call him hither ; We are reconcil'd , and the first view shall kill All repetition . Let him not ask our pardon : The nature of his great offence is dead , And deeper than oblivion we do bury The incensing relics of it : let him approach , A stranger , no offender ; and inform him So 'tis our will he should . I shall , my liege . What says he to your daughter ? have you spoke ? All that he is hath reference to your highness . Then shall we have a match . I have letters sent me , That set him high in fame . He looks well on't . I am not a day of season , For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail In me at once ; but to the brightest beams Distracted clouds give way : so stand thou forth ; The time is fair again . My high-repented blames , Dear sovereign , pardon to me . All is whole ; Not one word more of the consumed time . Let's take the instant by the forward top , For we are old , and on our quick'st decrees The inaudible and noiseless foot of time Steals ere we can effect them . You remember The daughter of this lord ? Admiringly , my liege : At first I stuck my choice upon her , ere my heart Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue , Where the impression of mine eye infixing , Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me , Which warp'd the line of every other favour ; Scorn'd a fair colour , or express'd it stolen ; Extended or contracted all proportions To a most hideous object : thence it came That she , whom all men prais'd , and whom myself , Since I have lost , have lov'd , was in mine eye The dust that did offend it . Well excus'd : That thou didst love her , strikes some scores away From the great compt . But love that comes too late , Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried , To the great sender turns a sour offence , Crying , 'That's good that's gone .' Our rasher faults Make trivial price of serious things we have , Not knowing them until we know their grave : Oft our displeasures , to ourselves unjust , Destroy our friends and after weep their dust : Our own love waking cries to see what's done , While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon . Be this sweet Helen's knell , and now forget her . Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin : The main consents are had ; and here we'll stay To see our widower's second marriage-day . Which better than the first , O dear heaven , bless ! Or , ere they meet , in me , O nature , cesse ! Come on , my son , in whom my house's name Must be digested , give a favour from you To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter , That she may quickly come . And every hair that's on't , Helen , that's dead , Was a sweet creature ; such a ring as this , The last that e'er I took her leave at court , I saw upon her finger . Hers it was not . Now , pray you , let me see it ; for mine eye , While I was speaking , oft was fasten'd to't . This ring was mine ; and , when I gave it Helen , I bade her , if her fortunes ever stood Necessitied to help , that by this token I would relieve her . Had you that craft to reave her Of what should stead her most ? My gracious sovereign , Howe'er it pleases you to take it so , The ring was never hers . Son , on my life , I have seen her wear it ; and she reckon'd it At her life's rate . I am sure I saw her wear it . You are deceiv'd , my lord , she never saw it : In Florence was it from a casement thrown me , Wrapp'd in a paper , which contain'd the name Of her that threw it . Noble she was , and thought I stood engag'd : but when I had subscrib'd To mine own fortune , and inform'd her fully I could not answer in that course of honour As she had made the overture , she ceas'd , In heavy satisfaction , and would never Receive the ring again . Plutus himself , That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine , Hath not in nature's mystery more science Than I have in this ring : 'twas mine , 'twas Helen's , Whoever gave it you . Then , if you know That you are well acquainted with yourself , Confess 'twas hers , and by what rough enforcement You got it from her . She call'd the saints to surety , That she would never put it from her finger Unless she gave it to yourself in bed , Where you have never come , or sent it us Upon her great disaster . She never saw it . Thou speak'st it falsely , as I love mine honour ; And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me Which I would fain shut out . If it should prove That thou art so inhuman ,'twill not prove so ; And yet I know not : thou didst hate her deadly , And she is dead ; which nothing , but to close Her eyes myself , could win me to believe , More than to see this ring . Take him away . My fore-past proofs , howe'er the matter fall , Shall tax my fears of little vanity , Having vainly fear'd too little . Away with him ! We'll sift this matter further . If you shall prove This ring was ever hers , you shall as easy Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence , Where yet she never was . I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings . Gracious sovereign , Whether I have been to blame or no , I know not : Here's a petition from a Florentine , Who hath , for four or five removes come short To tender it herself . I undertook it , Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech Of the poor suppliant , who by this I know Is here attending : her business looks in her With an importing visage , and she told me , In a sweet verbal brief , it did concern Your highness with herself . "Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead , I blush to say it , he won me . Now is the Count Rousillon a widower : his vows are forfeited to me , and my honour's paid to him . He stole from Florence , taking no leave , and I follow him to his country for justice . Grant it me , O king ! in you it best lies ; otherwise a seducer flourishes , and a poor maid is undone . DIANA CAPILET ." I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair , and toll for this : I'll none of him . The heavens have thought well on thee , Lafeu , To bring forth this discovery . Seek these suitors : Go speedily and bring again the count . I am afeard the life of Helen , lady , Was foully snatch'd . Now , justice on the doers ! I wonder , sir , sith wives are monsters to you , And that you fly them as you swear them lordship , Yet you desire to marry . What woman's that ? I am , my lord , a wretched Florentine , Derived from the ancient Capilet : My suit , as I do understand , you know , And therefore know how far I may be pitied . I am her mother , sir , whose age and honour Both suffer under this complaint we bring , And both shall cease , without your remedy . Come hither , county ; do you know these women ? My lord , I neither can nor will deny But that I know them : do they charge me further ? Why do you look so strange upon your wife ? She's none of mine , my lord . If you shall marry , You give away this hand , and that is mine ; You give away heaven's vows , and those are mine ; You give away myself , which is known mine ; For I by vow am so embodied yours That she which marries you must marry me ; Either both or none . Your reputation comes too short for my daughter : you are no husband for her . My lord , this is a fond and desperate creature , Whom sometime I have laugh'd with : let your highness Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour Than for to think that I would sink it here . Sir , for my thoughts , you have them ill to friend , Till your deeds gain them : fairer prove your honour , Than in my thought it lies . Good my lord , Ask him upon his oath , if he does think He had not my virginity . What sayst thou to her ? She's impudent , my lord ; And was a common gamester to the camp . He does me wrong , my lord ; if I were so , He might have bought me at a common price : Do not believe him . O ! behold this ring , Whose high respect and rich validity Did lack a parallel ; yet for all that He gave it to a commoner o' the camp , If I be one . He blushes , and 'tis it : Of six preceding ancestors , that gem Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue , Hath it been ow'd and worn . This is his wife : That ring's a thousand proofs . Methought you said You saw one here in court could witness it . I did , my lord , but loath am to produce So bad an instrument : his name's Parolles . I saw the man to-day , if man he be . Find him , and bring him hither . What of him ? He's quoted for a most perfidious slave , With all the spots of the world tax'd and debosh'd , Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth . Am I or that or this for what he'll utter , That will speak anything ? She hath that ring of yours . I think she has : certain it is I lik'd her , And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth . She knew her distance and did angle for me , Madding my eagerness with her restraint , As all impediments in fancy's course Are motives of more fancy ; and , in fine , Her infinite cunning , with her modern grace , Subdued me to her rate ; she got the ring , And I had that which any inferior might At market-price have bought . I must be patient ; You , that have turn'd off a first so noble wife , May justly diet me . I pray you yet , Since you lack virtue I will lose a husband , Send for your ring ; I will return it home , And give me mine again . I have it not . What ring was yours , I pray you ? Sir , much like The same upon your finger . Know you this ring ? this ring was his of late . And this was it I gave him , being a-bed . The story then goes false you threw it him Out of a casement . I have spoke the truth . My lord , I do confess the ring was hers . You boggle shrewdly , every feather starts you . Is this the man you speak of ? Ay , my lord . Tell me , sirrah , but tell me true , I charge you , Not fearing the displeasure of your master , Which , on your just proceeding I'll keep off , By him and by this woman here what know you ? So please your majesty , my master hath been an honourable gentleman : tricks he hath had in him , which gentlemen have . Come , come , to the purpose : did he love this woman ? Faith , sir , he did love her ; but how ? How , I pray you ? He did love her , sir , as a gentleman loves a woman . How is that ? He loved her , sir , and loved her not . As thou art a knave , and no knave . What an equivocal companion is this ! I am a poor man , and at your majesty's command . He is a good drum , my lord , but a naughty orator . Do you know he promised me marriage ? Faith , I know more than I'll speak . But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest ? Yes , so please your majesty . I did go between them , as I said ; but more than that , he loved her , for , indeed , he was mad for her , and talked of Satan , and of limbo , and of Furies , and I know not what : yet I was in that credit with them at that time , that I knew of their going to bed , and of other motions , as promising her marriage , and things which would derive me ill will to speak of : therefore I will not speak what I know . Thou hast spoken all already , unless thou canst say they are married : but thou art too fine in thy evidence ; therefore stand aside . This ring , you say , was yours ? Ay , my good lord . Where did you buy it ? or who gave it you ? It was not given me , nor I did not buy it . Who lent it you ? It was not lent me neither . Where did you find it , then ? I found it not . If it were yours by none of all these ways , How could you give it him ? I never gave it him . This woman's an easy glove , my lord : she goes off and on at pleasure . This ring was mine : I gave it his first wife . It might be yours or hers , for aught I know . Take her away ; I do not like her now . To prison with her ; and away with him . Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring Thou diest within this hour . I'll never tell you . Take her away . I'll put in bail , my liege . I think thee now some common customer . By Jove , if ever I knew man , 'twas you . Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while ? Because he's guilty , and he is not guilty . He knows I am no maid , and he'll swear to't ; I'll swear I am a maid , and he knows not . Great king , I am no strumpet , by my life ; I am either maid , or else this old man's wife . She does abuse our ears : to prison with her ! Good mother , fetch my bail . Stay , royal sir ; The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for , And he shall surety me . But for this lord , Who hath abus'd me , as he knows himself , Though yet he never harm'd me , here I quit him : He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd , And at that time he got his wife with child : Dead though she be , she feels her young one kick : So there's my riddle : one that's dead is quick ; And now behold the meaning . Is there no exorcist Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes ? Is't real that I see ? No , my good lord ; 'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see ; The name and not the thing . Both , both . O ! pardon . O my good lord ! when I was like this maid , I found you wondrous kind . There is your ring ; And , look you , here's your letter ; this it says : When from my finger you can get this ring , And are by me with child , &c . This is done : Will you be mine , now you are doubly won ? If she , my liege , can make me know this clearly , I'll love her dearly , ever , ever dearly . If it appear not plain , and prove untrue , Deadly divorce step between me and you ! O ! my dear mother ; do I see you living ? Mine eyes smell onions ; I shall weep anon . Good Tom Drum , lend me a handkercher : so , I thank thee . Wait on me home , I'll make sport with thee : let thy curtsies alone , they are scurvy ones . Let us from point to point this story know , To make the even truth in pleasure flow . If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower , Choose thou thy husband , and I'll pay thy dower ; For I can guess that by thy honest aid Thou keptst a wife herself , thyself a maid . Of that , and all the progress , more and less , Resolvedly more leisure shall express : All yet seems well ; and if it end so meet , The bitter past , more welcome is the sweet . Spoken by the The king's a beggar , now the play is done : All is well ended if this suit be won That you express content ; which we will pay , With strife to please you , day exceeding day : Ours be your patience then , and yours our parts ; Your gentle hands lend us , and take our hearts .
