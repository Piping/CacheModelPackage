Nay , lay thee down and roar , For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent That e'er did lift up eye . O ! she was foul . I scarce did know you , uncle . There lies your niece , Whose breath , indeed , these hands have newly stopp'd : I know this act shows terrible and grim . Poor Desdemona ! I am glad thy father's dead . Thy match was mortal to him , and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain : did he live now , This sight would make him do a desperate turn , Yea , curse his better angel from his side , And fall to reprobation . 'Tis pitiful ; but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed ; Cassio confess'd it : And she did gratify his amorous works With that recognizance and pledge of love Which I first gave her . I saw it in his hand : It was a handkerchief , an antique token My father gave my mother . O heaven ! O heavenly powers ! Come , hold your peace . 'Twill out , 'twill out ; I hold my peace , air ? no ; No , I will speak as liberal as the north ; Let heaven and men and devils , let them all , All , all , cry shame against me , yet I'll speak . Be wise , and get you home . I will not . Fie ! Your sword upon a woman ? O thou dull Moor ! that handkerchief thou speak'st of I found by fortune and did give my husband ; For often , with a solemn earnestness , More than , indeed , belong'd to such a trifle , He begg'd of me to steal it . Villanous whore ! She give it Cassio ! no , alas ! I found it , And I did give 't my husband . Filth , thou liest ! By heaven , I do not , I do not , gentlemen . O murderous coxcomb ! what should such a fool Do with so good a wife ? Are there no stones in heaven But what serve for the thunder ? Precious villain ! The woman falls : sure , he has kill'd his wife . Ay , ay ; O ! lay me by my mistress' side . He's gone ; but his wife's kill'd . 'Tis a notorious villain . Take you this weapon , Which I have here recover'd from the Moor . Come , guard the door without ; let him not pass , But kill him rather . I'll after that same villain , For 'tis a damned slave . I am not valiant neither , But every puny whipster gets my sword . But why should honour outlive honesty ? Let it go all . What did thy song bode , lady ? Hark , canst thou hear me ? I will play the swan , And die in music : Willow , willow , willow . Moor , she was chaste ; she lov'd thee , cruel Moor ; So come my soul to bliss as I speak true ; So speaking as I think , I die , I die . I have another weapon in this chamber ; It is a sword of Spain , the ice brook's temper . O ! here it is . Uncle , I must come forth . If thou attempt it , it will cost thee dear : Thou hast no weapon , and perforce must suffer . Look in upon me then , and speak with me , Or , naked as I am , I will assault thee . What is the matter ? Behold ! I have a weapon ; A better never did itself sustain Upon a soldier's thigh : I have seen the day , That with this little arm , and this good sword , I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop : but , O vain boast ! Who can control his fate ? 'tis not so now . Be not afraid , though you do see me weapon'd ; Here is my journey's end , here is my butt , And very sea-mark of my utmost sail . Do you go back dismay'd ? 'tis a lost fear ; Man but a rush against Othello's breast , And he retires . Where should Othello go ? Now how dost thou look now ? O ill-starr'd wench ! Pale as thy smock ! when we shall meet at compt , This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven , And fiends will snatch at it . Cold , cold , my girl ! Even like thy chastity . O ! cursed , cursed slave . Whip me , ye devils , From the possession of this heavenly sight ! Blow me about in winds ! roast me in sulphur ! Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire ! O Desdemona ! Desdemona ! dead ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Where is this rash and most unfortunate man ? That's he that was Othello ; here I am . Where is that viper ? bring the villain forth . I look down towards his feet ; but that's a fable . If that thou be'st a devil , I cannot kill thee . Wrench his sword from him . I bleed , sir ; but not kill'd . I am not sorry neither ; I'd have thee live ; For , in my sense , 'tis happiness to die . O thou Othello ! that wert once so good , Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave , What shall be said to thee ? Why , any thing : An honourable murderer , if you will ; For nought did I in hate , but all in honour . This wretch hath part confess'd his villany : Did you and he consent in Cassio's death ? Ay . Dear general , I never gave you cause . I do believe it , and I ask your pardon . Will you , I pray , demand that demi-devil Why he hath thus ensnar'd my soul and body ? Demand me nothing : what you know , you know : From this time forth I never will speak word . What ! not to pray ? Torments will ope your lips . Well , thou dost best . Sir , you shall understand what hath befall'n , Which , as I think , you know not . Here is a letter Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo , And here another ; the one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By Roderigo . O villain ! Most heathenish and most gross ! Now here's another discontented paper , Found in his pocket too ; and this , it seems , Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain , But that , belike , Iago in the interim Came in and satisfied him . O the pernicious caitiff ! How came you , Cassio , by that handkerchief That was my wife's ? I found it in my chamber ; And he himself confess'd but even now That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire . O fool ! fool ! fool ! There is besides in Roderigo's letter How he upbraids Iago that he made him Brave me upon the watch ; whereon it came That I was cast : and even but now he spake , After long seeming dead , Iago hurt him , Iago set him on . You must forsake this room and go with us ; Your power and your command is taken off , And Cassio rules in Cyprus . For this slave , If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long , It shall be his . You shall close prisoner rest . Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state . Come , bring him away . Soft you ; a word or two before you go . I have done the state some service , and they know't ; No more of that . I pray you , in your letters , When you shall these unlucky deeds relate , Speak of me as I am ; nothing extenuate , Nor set down aught in malice : then , must you speak Of one that lov'd not wisely but too well ; Of one not easily jealous , but , being wrought , Perplex'd in the extreme ; of one whose hand , Like the base Indian , threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe ; of one whose subdu'd eyes Albeit unused to the melting mood , Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees Their med'cinable gum . Set you down this ; And say besides , that in Aleppo once , Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk Beat a Venetian and traduc'd the state , I took by the throat the circumcised dog , And smote him thus . O bloody period ! All that's spoke is marr'd . I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee ; no way but this , Killing myself to die upon a kiss . This did I fear , but thought he had no weapon ; For he was great of heart . O Spartan dog ! More fell than anguish , hunger , or the sea . Look on the tragic loading of this bed ; This is thy work ; the object poisons sight ; Let it be hid . Gratiano , keep the house , And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor , For they succeed on you . To you , lord governor , Remains the censure of this hellish villain , The time , the place , the torture ; O ! enforce it . Myself will straight aboard , and to the state This heavy act with heavy heart relate .
