as defined in Title 41 CFR Chapter 101 Part 101 30 was established to aid the national economy and promote greater efficiency in supply management operations throughout the Federal Government The objective of the FCS is to provide for the exclusive use and maintenance of a uniform system whereby all items of supply at each Federal Agency and their contractor activities are uniformly named described identified classified numbered assigned National Stock Numbers NSN and published to aid in managing all logistical functions and operations from determination of requirements through disposal NASA participation in the FCS permits greater efficiency in supply management operations by providing the following 2 1 1 1 Cross servicing within NASA and between NASA and other Government agencies including participation in Federal Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedure FEDSTRIP and when applicable Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedure programs MILSTRIP 2 1 1 2 On a supply item basis sources from which the supply item may be obtained 2 1 1 3 Cost savings through consolidation single item procurement and prevention of concurrent buying and selling of the same item 2 1 1 4 Reduction of inventories recordkeeping and storage space 2 1 1 5 Maximum utilization of excess and long supply quantities throughout the Federal Government 2 1 1 6 Statistical assistance for precise budget forecasting and financial accounting purposes 2 1 1 7 Maximum utilization of data processing facilities because of uniformity of identification data 2 1 1 8 Firm basis for the establishment and dissemination of standardization data 2 1 1 9 Access to the centralized Governmentwide technical and logistics management data of the Defense Logistics Information System DLIS located at the Defense Logistics Services Center DLSC Battle Creek Michigan and defined in Department of Defense 4100 39 M 2 2 Applicability 2 2 1 Each NASA activity and where applicable in accordance with paragraph 1 2 NASA onsite contractors shall participate in the maintenance and maximum utilization of the FCS and comply with the policies rules principles and procedures of the FCS 2 2 2 NASA contractors when authorized by their contracts under FAR Part 51 and NASA FAR Supplement Part 1851 Use of Government Sources by Contractors to acquire supplies or equipment from Department of Defense DoD Defense Logistics Agency DLA General Services Administration GSA or Federal Supply Schedule FSS sources are encouraged to do so provided such acquisition is determined to be cost effective and that the items to be acquired meet contractor requirements pertaining to suitability and delivery Duly authorized NASA contractors electing to acquire supplies or equipment from DLA DoD GSA and or FSS sources are required to participate in the FCS to that degree necessary to ensure the ongoing maintenance of current federal cataloging information on those items repetitively acquisitioned However this participation shall at a minimum include the registering and withdrawing of activity interest in an NSN the deletion or revision of item identification or management data or any other data required to ensure that the recorded data are maintained on a current basis and the participation in Item Reduction Studies 2 3 NASA Participation 2 3 1 As a civilian agency NASA is designated as a limited participant in the DLIS and NASA cataloging activities are data receivers of DLIS Simplified File Maintenance SFM outputs from DLSC This limited participant status dictates that when NASA cataloging activities originate any required Federal cataloging action they are submitted directly to GSA for the performance of all cataloging functions and or the preparation of data for submission to DLSC 2 3 2 After converting items to the FCS NASA cataloging activities must continue to provide for the identification and classification of personal property under their control and maintain uniform item management data that are required and suitable for interdepartmental supply activities Therefore NASA cataloging activities are required to take maintenance actions affecting the items contained in materials inventory that are included in the FCS These actions may include deletion or revision of item identification or management data or any other data required to ensure that the recorded data are maintained on a current basis 2 3 3 NASA activities requests for supply support new item identification changes to a Federal supply classification class cancellation of an NSN or other cataloging actions shall be submitted on an appropriate SF1303 Request for Cataloging or Supply Support Action or DoD Form 1685 Data Exchange to the GSA Cataloging Division FCMC Washington DC 20406 Registration and withdrawal actions must also be submitted to GSA 2 3 4 Provisioning and other preprocurement screening actions shall be submitted directly to DLSC as defined in paragraph 2 9 2

Creek MI for inquiries and orders concerning onetime purchase of Identification Lists Lumber Catalog Medical Catalog and Federal Item Identification Guides 2 7 Item Identification and Use of National Stock Numbers 2 7 1 The most important element of the FCS is the establishment of a unique identification for an item of supply Proper item identification is a fundamental prerequisite in the performance of all management operations The concept of an item of supply is expressed in and fixed by a Federal Item Identification that consists of the minimum data that is adequate to clearly establish the essential characteristics of the item give the item its unique character make use of and differentiate it from every other item of supply used in the Federal Government 2 7 2 Each NASA cataloging activity shall ensure that items authorized for Federal cataloging are properly identified and maintained in the FCS with one Federal Item Identification and has assigned one NSN 2 7 3 NASA activities shall follow four basic steps in the item identification process a Selecting the item name The identification data recorded and the Federal Supply Classification assigned an item are governed by the name selected for the item b Item Classification Classification is one aspect of cataloging that is the exclusive responsibility of activity catalogers c Development of descriptive and or reference data All descriptive characteristics of the item both physical and performance are identified d When the three functions shown above are accomplished appropriate documentation shall be prepared for submission and transmittal to GSA for the assignment of a NSN for those items meeting the FCS criteria defined in paragraph 207 2 7 4 NSN s and approved item names shall be used when available in all stock catalogs complete and without change The additional characteristic descriptions shown on the Federal Item Logistics Data Records may be used in whole or in part to the extent desired 2 7 5 The NSN when available shall be the only stock number in NASA supply operations The integrity of the NSN shall be maintained whenever it is employed in any operation or document 2 7 6 Local stock numbers containing the correct 4 digit Federal Supply Class and local item names may be used until related approved NSN and approved item names have been received at which time the local identifications shall be replaced If approved item names are available they must be used with local stock numbers NASA activities should periodically screen local stock numbers in order to attempt to convert them to NSN s 2 8 Determination of Items to be Cataloged 2 8 1 All items of personal property in civilian agency systems that are subject to repetitive procurement storage distribution and or issue whether locally purchased or centrally managed items shall be named described identified classified and numbered or cataloged in the FCS Federally cataloging an item should not be confused with the fact that all items of materials inventory not federally cataloged in the DLIS are subject to item identification using local stock numbers At NASA activities all items of material inventory with repetitive use except as excluded in 2 8 2 below are subject to be federally cataloged in accordance with the FCS The term repetitive shall be construed to mean continual or recurring requirements for an item of supply encompassing three or more demands on a supply system within a 6 month 180 day period of time 2 8 2 All items of personal property in the categories listed below with the exceptions so noted are to be excluded from the FCS unless circumstances exist in which it is determined that Federal item identification data shall be of value in NASA s supply management operation 2 8 2 1 Items procured on a one time direct delivery or infrequent basis that are not subject to centralized item inventory management reporting or stock control 2 8 2 2 Printed forms charts manuals books and other publications subject to central administrative or numbering controls within a NASA activity 2 8 2 3 Capital equipment items with the exception of equipment items carried in the materials inventory 2 8 2 4 Items of personal property on which security classification is imposed 2 8 2 5 Items procured in a foreign market for use in overseas activities 2 8 2 6 Space flight certified items applicable to spacecraft satellites rockets launch vehicles and associated nonflight ground or support system items 2 8 2 7 Obsolete military aircraft and one of a kind commercial aircraft modified to support NASA missions 2 9 Provisioning and Other Preprocurement Screening 2 9 1 The procedures identified in the DoD Manual 4100 38 M Provisioning and Other Pre procurement Screening are designed to provide item identification and management data as the result of screening the DLIS files this aids in the decision processes of provisioning and preprocurement actions Provisioning and other preprocurement screening is prescribed for items of supply being recommended or selected as support items 2 9 2 DoD 4100 38 M implements the provisioning and preprocurement mandate of DoD Directive 4130 2 The Federal Catalog System and requires mandatory participation in the DLSC DLIS provisioning screening program by all bureaus and agencies of the Department of Defense Federal civilian agencies and contractors acting as Government agents engaging in provisioning and other preprocurement actions 2 9 3 All NASA Centers and authorized contractors acting for NASA who perform provisioning and other preprocurement screening shall do so in accordance with this NPR and DoD 4100 38 M so as to accomplish the following a Limit the entry of new items into the Federal supply system b Determine support items necessary to operate and maintain end items c Prevent duplicate entry of items into the Federal supply system d Provide a data base for the continuation and accomplishment of provisioning procurement and cataloging functions e Utilize available stocks of items already in the supply system to meet provisioning and other logistics requirements to avoid unnecessary procurements The scope of items to be screened by a contractor shall be as specified in the contract 2 9 4 In lieu of submitting a request for screening directly to DLSC NASA Centers are authorized to accomplish such screening locally utilizing Federal Logistics Catalogs on CD ROM FEDLOG 2 10 General Information for Screening Requests 2 10 1 Requests for screening shall be submitted in accordance with the instructions and procedures contained in DoD 4100 38 M NASA contractors requiring provisioning screening must obtain approval from the contracting NASA Center s SEMO As a prerequisite of provisioning requests each NASA Center shall comply with the requirements governing the establishment of destination code and address registration data for Center or contractors which are to use the screening services The data shall identify and establish those activities which are authorized to submit screening requests receive the results of the screening and establish the media and mode for interchange of screening data The SEMO shall furnish the contractor a destination code and the Center assigned an activity code prior to the preparation of provisioning screening requests 2 10 2 All NASA activities and authorized contractors are required to be registered as users of the DLSC provisioning screening services and to have their requirements recorded in the DLSC Provisioning Screening Master Address Table If a contractor s address is other than that of the NASA Center it must be registered at DLSC Registration for contractors shall be obtained in the manner as shown below except the name and address of the contractor shall be used The use of provisioning screening does not establish a contractor as a participant in the FCS Center requests for new registrations changes in addresses or changes in output media requirements shall be submitted by the SEMO to NASA adquarters Security Logistics Aircraft and Industrial Relations Division Requests shall include the following p > a Recipient s complete mailing address b Media of output such as cards tape and wire c Alternate media of output d Destination code e Activity code f Authorization for
