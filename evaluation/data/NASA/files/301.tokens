Responsible Office Office of Human Capital Management 1 POLICY a It is NASA s policy to conduct integrated workforce planning in order to ensure the alignment of human resources with the Agency s strategic goals and in order to optimize the makeup and utilization of the Agency s human resources b It is NASA s policy to ensure workforce planning integration and collaboration at Agency and Center levels of all involved functions including Agency leadership mission program management and mission support through a Workforce Planning Governance Structure comprised of the following elements 1 A Workforce Planning Agency Governance Group WPAGG to include representation from three Agency level organizations the Office of Human Capital Management OHCM the Office of Program and Institutional Integration OPII and the Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation PA & E 2 A Workforce Planning Technical Team WPTT to include representation from NASA Centers Mission Directorates and the offices that comprise the Agency Governance Group 3 Additional issue based ad hoc technical teams established under the auspices of the WPTT to focus on specific issues c In order to ensure efficient utilization of the Agency s workforce it is NASA s policy to 1 Plan its workforce through an iterative process by which skills supply are matched with work demand so that civil service full time equivalent FTE and recurring on and near site contractor workyear equivalent WYE costs can be assigned to NASA s programs projects and mission support 2 Plan for its future workforce requirements as part of its annual strategic planning and integrated budget development process the Planning Programming Budgeting and Execution PPBE The PPBE process is set forth in the NASA Financial Management Requirements FMR Volume 4 Budget Formulation Policies related to the strategic workforce planning aspects of the PPBE include the following a Each PPBE cycle PA & E OHCM and OPII shall jointly develop a required sequence of workforce planning activities and analyses and set them forth in the annual PPBE Strategic Planning Guidance b The Agency shall conduct five year workforce planning in order to provide appropriate lead time for reshaping workforce and focus attention on long term workforce health As part of this planning Mission Directorates will ensure that programs projects develop five year FTE WYE requirements in the PPBE programming phase Mission support organizations will also develop these requirements c During programmatic planning Mission Directorates and Mission Support organizations taking into consideration Center inputs shall determine both civil service FTE workforce demand and recurring on and near site contractor WYE workforce demand for each Center at the project level for all years of the budget planning horizon FTE and WYE demand is determined by funding distribution the identification of roles work to be outsourced versus remaining in house and the work to be assigned to Centers versus what is to be competed d During programmatic planning Mission Directorates and Mission Support organizations shall further characterize civil service FTE workforce demand in competency terms in order to match it with projected civil service workforce supply at the Centers also characterized in competency terms Misalignments between civil service workforce supply and civil service demand will be identified e g available for new work [ AFNW ] employees excess work and then reduced through iterative programmatic planning and through mechanisms such as the assignment of new work movement of work packages or in sourcing e NASA s strategic acquisition process shall take workforce issues such as projected AFNW at Centers i e civil service personnel who are not planned to funded project or mission support work and excess work at Centers i e funded work that is in excess of available civil service personnel into consideration in the development of the Agency acquisition approach e g internal make or buy decisions Center assignments and contribute to the resolution of these workforce issues f The Mission Directorates and programs projects shall provide data and insight into future workforce requirements beyond fully defined work This will entail planning the maximum realistic amount of FTE to Centers including both firm requirements as well as possible assignments forecast requirements in order to focus Agency level problem solving on true misalignments rather than on those that will be resolved over time as the work requirements themselves are better defined g Centers and the OHCM shall mitigate final unresolved civil service workforce supply demand misalignments gaps that cannot be resolved through programmatic planning via human capital management approaches to reduce excess capacity competencies and skills through redeployment retraining and buyout etc or to increase competencies and skills through civil service recruitment training and development restructuring and succession management Workforce planning analysis will be used to target scale and time these human capital activities h The Agency shall assess overall workforce health at each of the Centers using the Measures of Workforce Capability scalability skill availability and access performance and proficiency sufficiency sustainability and utilization as a guide and communicate issues and risks to senior leadership 2 APPLICABILITY This NPD is applicable to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers including Component Facilities and Technical

September 10 2003 s Michael D Griffin ATTACHMENT A TEXT Responsibilities of Workforce Governance Structure Components a The Workforce Planning Agency Governance Group shall 1 develop workforce planning guidance and policies 2 manage planning activities within the Governance Structure 3 coordinate workforce planning activities within the NASA Planning Programming Budgeting Execution PPBE process 4 synthesize workforce analyses and 5 develop and communicate recommendations to Agency leadership and NASA Management Councils b The Workforce Planning Technical Team shall 1 serve as a permanent working team supporting the Agency Governance Group 2 perform workforce planning activities and analyses applying workforce planning guidance and policies to them 3 identify workforce risks that require Agency level attention 4 develop recommendations for solutions and 5 participate in process improvement and workforce planning capability development activities at the Center and Agency levels ATTACHMENT B TEXT Summary of Measures of Workforce Capability an Agency approach to comprehensive workforce assessment 1 Scalability Total Workforce Definition The agility speed and ease with which a Center is able to adjust the number of workforce FTE & WYE of different types to meet changes in workforce demand within an anticipated range of future work There are two dimensions to scalability a Increasing capacity civil service and or contractors quickly when needed for temporary or longer term requirements b Decreasing capacity civil service and or contractors quickly in a targeted and rational manner when not needed for periods of time or no longer needed 2 Skill Availability and Access Total Workforce Definition The extent to which a Center has access when needed through civil service workforce or contractors to skill areas at an acceptable quality level for the range of anticipated work over the planning horizon This definition addresses the ability of the Center to get the skills or more of them when they are needed Note this measure is not asking about the Center s authority to hire [ ceilings or hiring controls ] Instead it is assessing whether if hiring authority or procurement were in place a Center could get the skills 3 Performance and Proficiency Total Workforce Definition The extent to which civil service and contractor performance is or is anticipated to be reliable for the range of work in the planning horizon particularly workforce associated with work that is new high risk or inflexible in terms of schedule or cost 4 Sufficiency Civil Service Workforce Definition The degree to which the Center has sufficient capacity appropriate skill mix and competence within the civil service workforce the Government footprint to fulfill Government unique management and oversight responsibilities inherently and appropriately governmental including Executive Managerial Leadership Business Management Program Project Management Technical Leadership and Contractor Oversight 5 Sustainability Civil Service Workforce Definition The extent to which Centers have sufficient bench strength over time to sustain agreed upon levels of internal capacity in key business technical and managerial positions to grow in house skills and replace the workforce as they move internally or leave the organization 6 Utilization Civil Service Workforce Definition The degree to which the civil service workforce is used efficiently to perform the work of the Center within the range of work over the planning horizon best case baseline case and worst case This measure involves two closely related factors a Workforce Coverage The anticipated civil service workforce coverage by budgeted FTE dollars given the range of work b Staffing Efficiency The utilization of staff assigned to funded work including full productivity of staff and proper alignment of skills and grade levels to the work suitability of work assignments URL for Graphic
