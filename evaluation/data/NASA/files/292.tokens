Subject Communications and Material Review Responsible Office Office of Communications 1 POLICY This NASA policy directive establishes the Communications Material Review CMR system to help ensure that NASA funded communications material effectively and consistently conveys information about NASA s mission projects programs safety practices and other activities for internal audiences or for external audiences or for a combination of both audiences Internal audiences are defined as NASA employees and NASA contractors External audiences are defined as all others including but not limited to the public schools colleges universities conference attendees all media media outlets and social media followers as well as Federal state and local governmental entities Efficient coordination and effective management of NASA resources enable more strategically focused communications Through adherence to the CMR policy the NASA Graphics Standards Manual Style Guide and the NASA Communications Portfolio system NASA will ensure visual consistency of its communications products In addition the CMR system supports effective utilization of resources to avoid redundancy and minimize waste However the CMR does not provide editorial review and approval of the content of NASA communications material 2 APPLICABILITY a This directive applies to NASA Headquarters all NASA Centers including Component Facilities and all individuals organizations or other entities that prepare create or determine communications material regardless of medium using NASA appropriated funds This language applies to JPL other contractors grant recipients or parties to agreements only to the extent specified or referenced in the appropriate contracts grants or agreements This NPD does not apply to the Office of the Inspector General b In this directive all mandatory actions i e requirements are denoted by statements containing the term shall The terms may or can denote discretionary privilege or permission should denotes a good practice and is recommended but not required will denotes expected outcome and are and is denotes descriptive material c In this directive all document citations are assumed to be the latest version unless otherwise noted 3 AUTHORITY a Release of Information to News and Information Media 14 CFR 1213 100 109 2007 b NASA Seal NASA Insignia NASA Logotype NASA Program

managing this directive b The Associate Administrator for Communications is responsible for developing policy and standards for communications material establishing goals and objectives and assessing CMR performance c The Associate Administrator for Communications has designated the CMR Lead to be responsible for the CMR process and to implement and monitor the Agency s use of the NASA Insignia and the NASA Unified Visual Communications System in accordance with the NASA Style Guide and NASA policy directives and Section 1221 100 et seq of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations 14 CFR 1221 In addition the CMR Lead will guide and direct the implementation of CMR policy including the Communications Portfolio system External use of the NASA Insignia will continue to be governed by 14 CFR 1221 with the NASA Associate Administrator for Communications and or designee reviewing use of the NASA Insignia by outside entities including but not limited to advertisers merchandisers filmmakers private companies etc d Each NASA Center will identify a Center CMR point of contact for implementing policies and methodology disseminating CMR information and standards and coordinating Center compliance with the CMR NASA Graphics Standards Manual Style Guide and Communications Portfolio requirements The authority of the Center point of contact will be established and supported by the Center Director and the Headquarters Office of Communications Center policies will adhere to the guidelines set out in this NPD e Each NASA Mission Directorate MD and Headquarters Mission Support Office MSO will designate a CMR point of contact for implementing policies and methodology disseminating CMR information and standards and coordinating MD and MSO compliance to the CMR process The authority of the point of contact will be established and supported by the MD or MSO director and the Headquarters Office of Communications 6 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY None 7 MEASUREMENTS An annual metrics report will be prepared by the Headquarters Office of Communications CMR Lead that will provide total materials created and produced arranged by type initiating office cost target audiences purpose and other measurements as deemed necessary by the Associate Administrator for Communications In addition metrics on the workflow process will be kept to help measure improvements This metrics report will be delivered to the Associate Administrator for Communications no later than the end of the fiscal year or the calendar year according to his or her requirements 8 CANCELLATION NPD 2521 1A
