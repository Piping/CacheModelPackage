items that are serviceable and ready for issue Credit shall be allowed only for returns that can be identified to the appropriation and accounting classification coding i e organization program project or functional category of the activity to which the original issue was made Credit shall not be allowed for Program Stock items of excess items bought directly items that cannot be returned to inventory due to poor condition or obsolescence and issues made prior to the beginning of the previous fiscal year 4 5 Adding Line Items to Inventory 4 5 1 Adding Line Items to Stores Stock 4 5 1 1 Each Center shall establish and maintain a system for adding line items to Stores Stock 4 5 1 2 Requests for stockage from Center personnel shall be used as a vehicle for adding line items to stock Such requests must indicate enough evidence to support the qualifications for stockage under the criteria of paragraph 3 5 Requests shall be signed and approved by responsible levels of management as designated by the Center 4 5 1 3 Center inventory management personnel shall review requests for stockage to ensure that line items having past sufficient demands or anticipated future demands warrant stockage Items qualifying for stockage shall be forwarded to the designated authority for approval 4 5 1 4 Approval to add qualifying line items to Stores Stock shall be granted by the SEMO or designee Decisions not to stock qualified line items shall be documented and retained by the supply organization The individual requesting that the line item be added to stock shall be notified of the decision to stock or not 4 5 1 5 Stores Stock items may be expended to maintained in and issued from an approved bench stock operation 4 5 2 Adding Line Items to Program Stock 4 5 2 1 Line items that meet the criteria for Program Stock see paragraph 3 2 2 shall be added only on written request of the program or project manager 4 5 2 2 Line items added to Program Stock are to be identified to a specific program or project 4 5 2 3 Program Stock items may be transferred to maintained in and issued from an approved bench stock operation 4 5 3 Adding Line Items to Standby Stock 4 5 3 1 Line items that meet the criteria for Standby Stock see paragraph 3 2 3 shall be added to inventory only upon written request by a division chief or equivalent The request shall be furnished to the SEMO and shall cite the justification for the items 4 6 Retention of Inventory 4 6 1 Stores Stock 4 6 1 1 Stores Stock items regardless of control systems that have been in inventory for at least 12 months shall be reviewed at least annually for retention or elimination For items under perpetual inventory control this review may be accomplished in conjunction with the reorder cycle or when the review point is reached 4 6 1 2 Items shall be retained in stock only if they meet the stockage criteria of paragraph 3 6 4 6 2 Program Stock 4 6 2 1 At least once every 2 years a list of items in Program Stock shall be provided to the controlling division chief or project manager for review and documentation of need for retention 4 6 2 2 If items are retained for a program and that program is canceled the items shall not be held unless another program is identified and the continued retention is justified by a division chief or project manager 4 6 2 3 In appropriate circumstances such as use of leased storage space the SEMO may levy storage charges for items retained in Program Stock 4 6 3 Standby Stock 4 6 3 1 At least once every 2 years a list of items in Standby Stock shall be provided to the controlling division chief or equivalent for review and indication of need for retention The justification for retention should state the purpose for which contingency items are being held 4 6 3 2 In appropriate circumstances such as use of leased storage space the SEMO may levy storage charges for items retained in Standby Stock 4 6 4 Basic requirements for retention of inventory are contained in Federal Property Management Regulations subchapter E subpart 101 27 304 Within NASA stock levels in excess of 60 months supply should not beretained Levels over the limit should be disposed of through normal excess procedures The SEMO may authorize beyond the 60 month period when circumstances such as cost to reorder and cost to hold clearly warrant such action When levels fall below the retention limit the reorder cycle may resume 4 6 5 The review of the economic retention limit shall occur at the same time as the review for continued stockage Months of supply shall be computed on the previous 12 months demand history 4 6 6 The economic retention limit may be increased when a The item is of special manufacture and relates to an end item of equipment that is expected to be in use beyond the economic retention time limit or b Costs incident to holding an additional quantity are insignificant and obsolescence or deterioration of the item is unlikely 4 6 7 The economic retention limit should be reduced when a The related end item of equipment is being phased out or an interchangeable item is available or b The item has limited storage life is likely to become obsolete or the age and condition of the item does not justify the full retention limit 4 6 8 The reasons for any increase or decrease to the economic retention limit shall be documented 4 6 9 Items that are marked for deletion from inventory shall be coded in the inventory control system to preclude reorder Users shall be notified that the item is to be eliminated from stock when the on hand balance is depleted through issue or excess They shall be either issued to users until stock is depleted or reported to the Center Property Disposal Office for redistribution and disposal Transferring excess items to the Property Disposal Office shall be considered as an adjustment of inventory see paragraph 4 7 3 4 A copy of the adjustment shall be sent by the SEMO to the Inventory Adjustment Officer or an automated adjustment transaction will be sent and the supporting document will be maintained by the SEMO 4 6 10 The SEMO may hold material items on a temporary basis for a user activity The nature of NASA operations occasionally makes it desirable to temporarily store user owned items in appropriate storage facilities for a specified period of time A using activity may request in writing that the SEMO temporarily store materials such as seasonal items and items for a planned work or job order until they are actually needed The requestmust state the specific time period for the temporary storage and the reason for storage The reason should clearlystate the reasons that items cannot be currently used or retained in the user s organization 4 6 11 NASA Centers are authorized to establish and maintain Bench Stocks which consist of low cost repetitively used consumption type items located at or near points of use to ensure continuous and uninterrupted operations Bench Stocks by providing such items in close proximity to the user reduce the user s need to constantly requisition repetitively required items from a central supply 4 6 11 1 With the concurrence of the Center SEMO a using activity may establish a Bench Stock operation identifying the specific items and the maximum and minimum quantities of the items to be maintained therein At the discretion of local management the SEMO may establish and operate a Bench Stock in support of a using activity 4 6 11 2 Bench Stocks are not to be used as a repository for excess items which cannot otherwise be justified for retention in authorized stores Program or Standby Stocks The specific requirement for establishing and operating a Bench Stock is as follows a The using activity and the SEMO shall jointly determine the location of Bench Stocks and the items and the quantities of the items to be maintained in the designated Bench Stocks b For Bench Stock items drawn or pre expended from or through Stores Stock and Program Stock inventories the maximum quantity maintained per line item should not exceed a 60 day supply c Bench Stocks shall have records sufficient for identifying the 1 stock or part number 2 name 3 unit of issue 4 unit price 5 stock level maximum and minimum quantities to be stocked and 6 stock resupply point of the items maintained therein d An individual shall be designated to oversee the Bench Stock The individual shall be responsible at a minimum for 1 adding items to and deleting items from the Bench Stock 2 ensuring that the quantities of items maintained in the Bench Stock do not exceed the dollar value and usage thresholds 3 establishing a simplified method for tracking items received in and drawn from the Bench Stock and 4 periodically reviewing the Bench Stock to effect resupply as necessary e Controls shall be established to ensure that only authorized users draw items from the Bench Stocks 4 6 11 3 Every effort shall be made to keep Bench Stocks within the designated usage threshold However there may be occasions when it is justified to exceed the threshold on a temporary and limited basis When this occurs the using activity shall request approval from the SEMO to temporarily exceed the threshold 4 7 Adjustments to Materials Inventory 4 7 1 NASA materials inventory records shall accurately reflect the balance of material assets on hand and must be reconcilable with financial records When discrepancies exist between records and material assets prompt action must be taken to correct determine the cause and update balances as necessary Inventory adjustments are to be used when transaction documents have not been processed or cannot be located to account for the discrepancies 4 7 2 Record searches to reverse incorrect transactions should be reasonably thorough but consistent with the magnitude of the error and the probability of individual neglect or misconduct Except for special item controls transaction record searches are not required when the extended value of discrepancy is less than $ 50 Such discrepancies may be automatically adjusted however the require inventory adjustment document must be processed The automatic adjustment does not apply to special controlled items that must be fully researched regardless of value of the discrepancy When materials inventory records are adjusted corresponding adjustments must be made in the appropriate General Ledger Accounts Financial Management Manual 9220 and must befunded by losses or credited to gains to appropriated monies 4 7 3 The following transactions cause gains or losses to the Inventory General Ledger Account 1200 and shall be reported to the Center Financial Management Office 4 7 3 1 Adjustment of discrepancies between the recorded balance and the physical count quantity of items as a result of a physical inventory see chapter 5 4 7 3 2 Dropping accountability of materials inventory items that are unserviceable due to damage and destruction obsolescence and deterioration loss or theft 4 7 3 3 Adjustment of record to correct operational errors that cannot be referenced to the original transaction document 4 7 3 4 Transfer of excess materials to the PDO delete value from Account 1200 4 7 3 5 Return to vendors or suppliers when no other type of transaction is appropriate 4 7 4 Adjustments from subparagraphs 4 7 3 1 through 4 7 3 5 shall be processed for approval as follows 4 7 4 1 When the total dollar value of any one line item is $ 500 or more the adjustment report shall be certified by the SEMO or designee and approved by the Inventory Adjustment Officer IAO Adjustments from subparagraphs 4 7 3 4 and 5 regardless of dollar value of the quantity adjusted may be approved by eitherthe IAO the SEMO or a designee 4 7 4 2 When the total dollar value of any one item is less than $ 500 the adjustment may be certified by a designated individual and approved by the SEMO or a designee other than the certifying individual 4 7 4 3 Approving officials should be satisfied that the adjustment is not the result of carelessness or misappropriation of property If either condition is suspected the official shall require a survey report The adjustment report shall be approved subject to this action and processed for correction of the inventory records without waiting for the results of the survey action The SEMO is responsible for initiating property survey action following the guidance in NPR 4200 1 NASA Equipment Management Manual 4 7 4 4 An explanation of the reasons for all adjustments including shipments or returns to suppliers and transfers of excesses to the PDO shall be recorded in the automated system and entered in the remarks section of the adjustment report In the automated format the following codes shall be used to identify the adjustments listed in subparagraph 4 7 3 Discrepancy
