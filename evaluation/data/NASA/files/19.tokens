an emergency preparedness plan for the Center s Human Space Flight Program Operations 2 Ensuring if appropriate to the Center s role and responsibilities in human space flight that the prime objectives of medical activities in support of ground based and in flight tests checkouts and simulations are met Specifically these objectives are as follows a To verify that human support equipment fulfills design quality and safety requirements needed for the useful and efficient functioning of individuals in both ground based and in flight environments b To ensure that crewmember health is optimized to maximize crewmember performance during flight c To establish the requirements for and collaborate with the HEOMD to monitor the progress of health and medical research to support crew health d To ensure that environmental medical and safety reviews of equipment and biomedical research protocols are in accordance with the JSC Institutional Review Board IRB standards including policies and procedures outlined in NPD 7100 8 Protection of Human Research Subjects e To conduct hardware tests verifications and procedural simulations as necessary of any equipment prior to testing on humans 6 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY None 7 MEASUREMENT VERIFICATION An annual report will be issued by medical operations at JSC to the CHMO indicating the number of medical events affecting space flight crewmembers that result in adverse mission impact The lower the number of medical events affecting space flight crewmembers that result in adverse mission impact the greater the success of the program 8 CANCELLATION NPD 8900 1G Medical Operations Responsibilities in Support of Human Space Flight programs dated May 31 2002 Revalidated August 25 2012 with change 1 original signed by
