1 08 27 2012 Policy and responsibilities updated to clarify launch vehicles certification requirements in order to comply with the Agency s direction NPD 8610 7D also updated to comply with content and structure requirements for agency level directives 1 POLICY a It is NASA s policy to have a mixed fleet launch strategy to utilize both existing and emerging domestic launch capability to assure access to space for NASA payloads and their related missions This directive addresses the process that enables NASA to take advantage of the full range of available launch capability while ensuring that the risks associated with access to space are consistent with the risk classification approved for individual payloads and missions This directive complies with the requirement for program risk management documented in NASA Procedural Requirements NPR 7120 5 NASA Space Flight Program and Project Management Requirements b It is also NASA s policy consistent with the United States U S Space Transportation Policy that U S Government payloads shall be launched on launch vehicles manufactured in the U S unless exempted by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and or as part of an approved international cooperative mission with launch contributed on a no funds exchanged basis NASA s launch vehicle assignment and acquisition policy seek to balance launch risk for individual missions with demonstrated launch vehicle history flight anomaly and mission failure resolution if any and NASA technical evaluation consistent with overall mission risk as follows 1 Launch vehicle mission risk classification and launch vehicle certification strategy including determination of certification alternative shall be reviewed and documented through the NASA Flight Planning Board FPB for each NASA mission launch contract award 2 This policy addresses three levels of launch vehicle risk for launches to earth orbit or beyond high medium and low NASA s approach to determine launch vehicle risk category and to mitigate the risks across category alternatives are through a launch vehicle certification process is described in Attachment A 3 Nothing contained within this policy directive shall preclude or restrict a source selection authority or NASA FPB from recommending for selection or selecting the utilization of a lower risk launch vehicle for any payload A payload defined as a Class D payload pursuant to NPR 8705 4 may utilize a common launch vehicle configuration certified to a Risk Category 2 or 3 A payload defined as a Class C or D payload pursuant to NPR 8705 4 may utilize a common launch vehicle configuration certified to Risk Category 3 4 An on orbit payload delivery services contract shall be considered on a case by case basis by the payload

5 2005 Revalidated on August 27 2012 w Change 1 Original signed by Administrator ATTACHMENT A NASA LAUNCH VEHICLE CERTIFICATION NASA s approach to determine launch vehicle risk category and to mitigate the risks across category alternatives are through a launch vehicle certification process summarized below identifies the requirements to obtain certification as outlined in the matrix provided at the end of the attachment A 1 A common launch vehicle configuration is a unique combination of core propulsive stages excluding strap on rocket motors and stages utilized explicitly for orbit escape or trim A successful flight is a flight which met the primary mission requirements A 2 Payloads classified as Class D payloads pursuant to NPR 8705 4 may be launched on Risk Category 1 launch vehicles i e a new common launch vehicle configuration with no prior demonstrated flight history and completion of NASA audits and evaluation of documentation specified in the matrix at the end of Attachment A Other high risk payload launch service options may be pursued through the FPB A 3 Payloads classified as Class C payloads and in some cases Class B payloads pursuant to NPR 8705 4 may be launched on Risk Category 2 launch vehicles that have demonstrated a limited history of successful flights Accordingly Class C payloads and in some cases Class B payloads may launch on a common launch vehicle configuration that has been certified by any one of the three following alternative methods A 3 1 Certification Alternative 1 provides for certification of a common launch vehicle configuration with a demonstrated flight record of a series of 6 consecutive successful flights of a common launch vehicle configuration i e 89 percent demonstrated reliability at 50 percent confidence using the binomial distribution without considering the other specific certification assurances which makes the confidence level appreciably higher and completion of NASA s evaluation of the limited additional documentation specified in the matrix at the end of Attachment A or A 3 2 Certification Alternative 2 provides for certification after three successful flights that include a minimum of two consecutive successful flights of a common launch vehicle configuration and completion of a NASA Design Certification Review NASA conducted Independent Verification and Validation IV & V of launch vehicle analyses and audits and evaluation of documentation specified in the matrix at the end of Attachment A A 3 3 Certification Alternative 3 provides for certification after one successful flight of a common launch vehicle configuration and completion of the NASA Engineering Review Boards audits and the evaluation of documentation specified in the matrix at the end of Attachment A A 4 Payloads which are classified as Class A and in some cases Class B payloads pursuant to NPR 8705 4 shall be launched on Risk Category 3 launch vehicles that have a more robust demonstrated successful flight history Accordingly payloads classified as Class A and in some cases Class B payloads may launch on a common launch vehicle configuration that has been certified by any one of the three following alternative methods A 4 1 Certification Alternative 1 provides for certification of a common launch vehicle configuration with a demonstrated flight record of a series of 14 consecutive successful flights of a common launch vehicle configuration i e 95 percent demonstrated reliability at 50 percent confidence level using the binomial distribution without considering the other specific certification assurances which makes the confidence level appreciably higher and completion of a NASA evaluation of the limited additional documentation specified in the matrix at the end of Attachment A or A 4 2 Certification Alternative 2 provides for certification after six successful flights that include a minimum of three consecutive successful flights of a common launch vehicle configuration and completion of a NASA Design Certification Review NASA conducted IV & V of launch vehicle analyses and audits and evaluation of documentation specified in the matrix at the end of Attachment A A 4 3 Certification Alternative 3 provides for certification after three successful flights that include a minimum of two consecutive successful flights of a common launch vehicle configuration and completion of extensive NASA technical evaluation audits and evaluation of the documentation specified in the matrix at the end of Attachment A A 5 NASA Flight Margin Verification FMV is required for all flight histories used to support Risk Category 2 and 3 certification of a common launch vehicle configuration FMV is a verification by NASA that the common launch vehicle configuration met the predicted vehicle and performance parameters e g within family and or within three sigma criteria Resolution of all flight anomalies and mission failures is required by the launch service contractor with Launch Services Program LSP technical evaluation and disposition A common launch vehicle configuration failure caused by a part or subsystem that has sufficient previous flight history as determined by the engineering technical authority for LSP does not automatically invalidate the consecutive success requirement LSP PLN 324 01 Expendable Launch Vehicle Certification Plan will identify criteria process for review of this condition A 6 NASA IV & V is a comprehensive assessment of the common launch vehicle analyses conducted by the launch service contractor It will be based on the complexities and heritage of the vehicle The LSP will propose the appropriate level of technical assessment LSP independent modeling launch service contractor model evaluation and or launch service contractor analytical review at a FPB used to assess the certification strategy for a specified common launch vehicle configuration NASA Launch Vehicle Certification Requirements Matrix
