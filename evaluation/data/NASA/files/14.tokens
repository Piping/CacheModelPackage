b NASA quality assurance programs shall 1 Be designed and implemented in a manner that mitigates risks associated with noncompliance Requirement Determination of risk considers the likelihood of noncompliance and the consequences associated with noncompliance including the maturity complexity criticality and value of work performed as well as demonstrated experience with past quality system

postwork assurance measures to ensure that work was properly performed e g inspections tests record review configuration control Requirement 5 Flow applicable quality assurance requirements down to successive levels of the supply chain to ensure control of subtier suppliers and verification of safety and mission critical attributes at all levels of the supply chain Requirement 6 Continually be improved through advocacy awareness training teaming and sharing of quality assurance tools techniques and data integration of quality assurance processes to prevent duplication of effort and dissemination implementation of lessons learned and best practices Requirement 7 Ensure that customers and Government authorities are quickly notified concerning noncompliant products or failure experiences potentially affecting product safety reliability or functionality Requirement 42136 Customers and Government authorities include contracting officers Government contract management agents

s of noncompliance and the scope population of noncompliant items Requirement b Corrective actions shall include the correction replacement repair or authorized disposition of noncompliant items conditions implementation of preventive measures to eliminate the causes of noncompliance and validation that implemented preventive measures have effectively eliminated recurrence of the noncompliant condition recurrence control Requirement 9 Ensure clear and mutual understanding of prescribed quality requirements among organizations responsible for contracting or assigning work performing work and assuring conformity of work Requirement 10 Be performed by persons that are competent on the basis of a Demonstrated knowledge skills and experience related to quality assurance principles and practices and related to the specific product process or attribute for which assurance is being provided Requirement b Meeting formal certification or qualification requirements where prescribed in required invoked documents or where deemed necessary to ensure personnel competency to perform specialized quality assurance functions Requirement 11 Be performed by persons that are not assigned direct responsibility for ensuring that cost or schedule objectives are met Requirement 12 Be supported by records demonstrating compliance with technical quality requirements Records shall be legible traceable to the applicable product identifiable to the applicable requirement and readily retrievable for requirement verification Requirement 13 Include the collection and analysis of quality data for the purpose of identifying and initiating resolution of problem areas e g projects products processes operations organizations common deficiency causes nonconformance trends defect anomalies and process variations Requirement 14 Be performed in accordance with a documented quality system that follows the criteria specified in Attachment A Requirement c Government quality assurance
