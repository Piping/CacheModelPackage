1 04 09 2014 Updated with 1400 compliance updated applicable documents and forms and Measurement Verification office name change and added Attachment A 1 POLICY a It is NASA s policy consistent with statutory requirements to promote the transfer and commercial utilization of inventions arising from NASA supported research or development in which NASA has an ownership interest by the licensing of such inventions Accordingly NASA maintains a Technology Transfer Program that ensures Agency processes are in place to protect intellectual property and transfer these assets in a manner that provides clear benefits for the Agency the domestic economy and the research community A key element of this activity is the licensing of NASA inventions b The following principles will be applied to accomplish the policy objectives set forth above 1 Pursuant to 35 U S C 207 Domestic and Foreign Protection of Federally Owned Inventions Federal agencies are authorized to grant exclusive partially exclusive or nonexclusive licenses on Federally owned inventions The term invention means any invention or discovery which is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under Title 35 U S C or any novel variety of plant which is or may be protectable under the Plant Variety Protection Act 2 No license will be granted to a potential licensee who has not provided NASA with a plan for development and or marketing of the invention at issue 3 Preference will be given to a potential licensee who agrees that any products embodying the invention or produced through the use of the invention at issue will be manufactured substantially in the United States 4 An exclusive or partially exclusive license will only be granted when all the following conditions are met a Granting the license is a reasonable and necessary incentive to call forth the investment capital and expenditures needed to bring the invention to practical application or otherwise promote the invention s utilization by the public b A finding is made by NASA that the public will be served by the granting of the license as indicated by the potential licensee s intentions plans and ability to bring the invention to practical application or otherwise promote the invention s utilization by the public and that the proposed scope of exclusivity is not greater than reasonably necessary to provide the incentive for bringing the invention to practical application as proposed by the potential licensee or otherwise promote the invention s utilization by the public c The potential licensee makes a commitment to achieve practical application of the invention within a reasonable time which time may be extended by NASA upon the potential licensee s request and the potential licensee s demonstration that the refusal of such extension would be unreasonable d Granting the license will not tend to substantially lessen competition or result in a violation of the Federal antitrust laws e In the case of an invention covered by a foreign patent application or patent the interests of the Federal Government or United States industry in foreign commerce will be enhanced 5 In negotiating terms for any license granted pursuant to this directive terms should be negotiated that provide the licensee incentive to commercialize the invention In the case of exclusive or partially exclusive licenses such terms shall not tend to substantially lessen competition or create or maintain a violation of Federal antitrust laws 6 In no case shall a NASA Center negotiate or enter into a license agreement without the involvement of both the Chief Technologist or designee s within Headquarters and at the Centers as prescribed by paragraph 5b of this directive and the General Counsel or designee s the Agency Counsel for Intellectual Property or Center Patent Intellectual Property Counsel as prescribed by paragraph 5c of this directive 7 The NASA model license agreement template as discussed further
