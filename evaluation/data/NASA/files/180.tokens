Subject Industrial Labor Relations Manual Revalidated April 10 2013 with admin changes Responsible Office Logistics Management Division Chapter 1 Introduction 1 1 Scope 1 1 1 The material in this manual is presented in the form of guidelines to assist NASA Center management in establishing local procedures for dealing with contractor labor management disputes This manual also implements the procedures for providing access for labor union representatives to conduct necessary union business at NASA facilities Included in the guidelines are suggestions for gathering and evaluating certain data and appropriate actions to be taken by NASA which may prevent or reduce the impact of a contractor labor dispute In addition a check list is provided for the actions to be taken by NASA in cases where a contractor strike situation is imminent Moreover included are procedures for requesting the removal of critical NASA parts materials from a manufacturer s strike bound plant and procedure for the preparation of variance hearings pursuant to section 4 c of the Service Contract Act of 1965 as amended These guidelines have been developed to allow considerable flexibility to meet unique situations that may exist at NASA Centers 1 1 2 It is essential that each NASA Center maintain a certain awareness of its contractor labor management relationships in order to be able to assess the seriousness of a potential or actual labor dispute e g the courses of action that are likely to be taken by other contractor employees civil service employees and unions concerning a dispute and the resultant impact to the NASA Center in terms of program delays and additional costs During periods of labor contract negotiations it is especially important to be aware of the status of such negotiations since an impasse could result in work stoppages that could adversely affect the NASA Center 1 1 3 Since contractor labor disputes vary and each one has its own particular problems NASA s role in contractor labor management disputes should be one of neutrality Care should be taken to ensure the Agency s position of neutrality in establishing local procedures from these guidelines 1 2 Policy NASA recognizes the legal right of contractor employees and unions to engage in collective bargaining including legitimate picketing at NASA Centers when an impasse is reached during a labor dispute or labor contract negotiations NASA officials should not become involved directly or take sides based on the merits of any labor dispute However in such cases appropriate actions should be taken by NASA to reduce or eliminate impact on its programs including actions to ensure access to the NASA Center by NASA personnel and by employees of other contractors who are not directly involved in the dispute 1 3 Applicability 1 3 1 These guidelines are applicable to all NASA Centers and Component Facilities Certain NASA Centers may need to deviate from the guidelines because of existing unique situations i e Marshall Space Flight Center as a tenant on an Army facility or Dryden Flight Research Center as a tenant on an Air Force facility The Kennedy Space Center may also need deviations from these guidelines because of joint Agency operations 1 3 2 At NASA Centers where tenant contractors operate inside the NASA facilities e g the Michoud Assembly Facility and the Stennis Space Center it is not necessary to maintain the data set forth in sections 2 1 and 3 2 for such tenant contractors However if it is anticipated that a labor dispute of a tenant contractor could have any impact on NASA operations the NASA Center should reach an understanding with each tenant contractor and the contracting agency that NASA will be advised of any impending labor dispute which may result in a strike In the event of a tenant contractor strike the reserve gate procedure should be implemented in accordance with the guideline provided in this manual NASA should be responsible for initiating the steps necessary to establish a reserve gate However some of the action items may be the responsibility of the tenant contractor or the responsible Government agency Any necessary changes in the responsibility for implementation of the reserve gate procedure agreed to by the parties NASA other Government agencies and the tenant contractor should be formalized and a copy of such understanding sent to NASA Headquarters Contractor Industrial Relations Officer 1 3 3 Since the problems arising from construction contractor labor disputes are frequently different from those of industrial contractors separate guidelines for construction contractor labor management disputes are set forth in chapter 3
