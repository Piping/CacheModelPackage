activity provides special benefits e g services goods or resources to an identifiable recipient above and beyond those which accrue to the public at large This policy includes but is not limited to sales agreements and leases Determination of special benefits is further explained in Office of Management Budget OMB Circular A 25 User Charges 1 In providing special benefits NASA will ensure that a NASA does not compete with the private sector when supplying special benefits b NASA promotes efficient allocation of resources by establishing charges that are at least as great as the costs to NASA of providing the special benefit 2 This policy is intended to be applied only to the extent permitted by law Where a statute prohibits the assessment of a user charge on a service or addresses an aspect of the user charge e g who pays the charge how much is the charge where collections are deposited etc the statute will take precedence over the policy The same analysis is applied to executive orders or OMB circulars that address user charges b Exceptions to recovery of cost 1 The provision of a free service is an appropriate courtesy to a foreign country or international organization or comparable fees are set on a reciprocal basis with a foreign country 2 The NASA Administrator or designee recommends and receives approval from OMB that an exception to the general policy is made because i the cost of collecting the fees would represent an unduly large part of the fee for the activity or ii any other condition exists that in the opinion of NASA s Administrator or designee justifies an exception Exceptions requested by the NASA Administrator or designee and granted by OMB shall be for a period of no more than four years unless renewed by the NASA Administrator or designee c Determining the amount of user charges to assess 1 The full cost or market price of Federal Government service from which a special benefit is derived will be determined from the best available records in the Agency New cost accounting systems need not be established solely for this purpose Refer to OMB Circular A 25 for general information on determining user charges refer to NASA

dollar amounts in order to adjust for changes in costs to the Government or changes in market prices of the good resource or service provided 4 When acting in its capacity as sovereign NASA shall assess sufficient user charges to cover the full cost of direct and indirect costs to NASA of carrying out the activity NASA acts in its capacity as sovereign when it exercises rights that it possesses by virtue of its status as a Federal agency and that enables NASA to carry out its official functions for the public benefit Costs may include but are not limited to the following a

assess a user charge based on the market price for leasing goods or resources or providing a service NASA generally does not act in its capacity as a sovereign when it exercises rights e g proprietary generally enjoyed by private entities Charges will be determined by the application of sound business management principles and in accordance with recognized appraisal methods and techniques used within the Federal Government Under these business type activities user charges need not be limited to the recovery of cost and may produce net revenues d NASA shall collect user charges in advance of or simultaneously with the rendering of services or goods unless appropriations and authority are provided that allow for providing the services or goods in advance of collection 2 APPLICABILITY a
