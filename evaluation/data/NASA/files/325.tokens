NPD 8900 31 Astronaut Medical and Dental Observation Study and Care Program and this NPD NPD 7100 8 Protection of Human Research Subjects when both apply simultaneously during the performance of an astronaut s duties These guidelines address the multiplicity of issues surrounding the medical support of astronauts and of the NASA supported space crews as well as their participation in biomedical research as research subjects They provide guidance and direction in the ethical practice of medical care and conduct of human research in support of space missions D 2 POLICY a Medical support of astronauts and of the NASA supported space crews prior to spaceflight while in space and after spaceflight is guided by practices established or approved by the Medical Policy Board and or the CHMO includes the application of approved countermeasures Medical management is the responsibility of the attending flight surgeon Basic medical monitoring countermeasures and clinical treatment protocols and their frequency will be independently evaluated periodically by an expert team reporting to the Medical Policy Board and CHMO This evaluation will assess the actual risk benefit and value of treatments This medical support plan and requirements should be based on 1 evidence based knowledge of physiological responses to spaceflight 2 knowledge of the specific mission scenario and crewmember s activities timeline 3 knowledge of the specific all inclusive research protocol in which the crewmember participates as a research subject and the research protocol timelines 4 monitoring of select environmental parameters and their changes for possible interactions with the research protocols countermeasures or medical monitoring or treatment Flight surgeons are responsible for 1 monitoring the health of the crew during the conduct of research protocols and assessing the crewmember s continued suitability as a subject 2 remaining cognizant of the particular experimental research outcomes when they are reported after the flight is completed 3 developing and continuously updating requirements for operational clinical research b Biomedical Research Biomedical Research is designed to 1 develop the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the changes during and after spaceflight 2 design evaluate and validate appropriate countermeasures and rehabilitation procedures based on the knowledge from i 3 provide the pathophysiological evidence required for safe and effective medical care in space and after flight All monitoring or testing other than that essential to medical care and health maintenance of astronauts and the NASA supported space crews should be considered biomedical research in that it is presumed that a hypothesis has been formulated that similar procedures or data are required from more than one subject and the proposal was designed in a scientifically valid manner All research will be independently peer reviewed All flight experimental research conducted concurrently on the same crewmember will be integrated into a single protocol and will be reviewed by the IRB at the JSC for risk taking into account interactions with mission activities environmental data and medical care activities c Coordination of Medical Care and Biomedical Research This Appendix is designed to ensure full integration of methods to foster a commitment among the astronaut corps the NASA supported space crews the flight surgeons and the research community to define and optimize biomedical operational and research objectives for each flight mission or Space Station operation The Space and Life Sciences Directorate at JSC will be responsible for ensuring this integration 1 Research protocols and health care monitoring requirements will be coordinated when possible into a single activity and timeline to avoid duplication and unnecessary interference with the crewmember 2 Mission timelines and research protocols will be planned in coordination with the medical operational activities to minimize impact on health and safety of crewmembers and ensure integrity of research data 3 Research data obtained from astronauts is not to be used for medical or flight certification purposes It may be available as background information to be used when required for medical care or for medical emergency purposes during and after flight 4 The following guidance applies Before a researcher has access to medical data a crewmember s informed consent and an assurance of confidentiality will be required to be on file in order to preclude the inappropriate release or use of any medical data Investigators should identify in their proposals and revise as necessary prior to the mission applicable health environmental or mission activities data that might impact the research protocol s Applicable deviations in the mission profiles and appropriate data will be reported to the PI in a timely fashion to ensure research integrity Research data will not be presented or published in any way that allows identification of the participating crewmember or other subjects without their explicit written consent s d Bioethics of crewmembers volunteering as research subjects 1 Prior to selection as astronauts applicants should be provided with information to ensure that they understand that they will be asked to volunteer to participate as research subjects during the course of their employment with NASA Additionally they should be informed that as research subjects they have certain rights including the right to refuse to participate and the right to withdraw from participation This information should be presented fairly and objectively to avoid real or perceived coercion 2 Informed consent and consent forms should be comprehensive and in simple layman s language and should also address the purpose of the research and the disposition of the data Research subjects can withdraw consent at any time including after the commencement of the research 3 Potential crew members expected to volunteer as human subjects will receive an in depth briefing of all biomedical experiments including attendant risks and integrated risks to obtain informed consent for participation prior to assignment as a crewmember to that flight 4 Data and results from the research and their significance should be appropriately briefed to the participating crewmembers before publication in the open literature 5 Periodic informational and educational briefings on major biomedical findings and their implications from space missions will be provided by the PI or life sciences research personnel to the astronaut corps e Effective date This guidance is effective with the date of issuance and the signature of the Chief Health and Medical Officer NASA Metrics or measurements of Agency compliance with this policy for the protection of human subjects in NASA research are the following 1 Percentage of NASA Centers with active MPA and certifying letters on file with the authorized NASA official 2 Percentage of NASA Centers filing timely MPA s or certifying letters 3 Number of research proposals reviewed by IRB s 4 Number of
