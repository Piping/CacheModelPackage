While the Exchange Visitor is not required to exhaust all other forms of relief under the immigration laws NASA will not request a waiver if a simpler more direct means of relief is available such as extension of the Exchange Visitor s nonimmigrant J 1 visa or obtaining a waiver based on a no objection statement from the Exchange Visitors home country or last country of residence 3 2 4 The NASA supported project under which the Exchange Visitor has worked should have a planned period of performance based on an actual obligation of funds or assurances from the responsible NASA officer that

of his her Exchange Visitor s nonimmigrant visa If this is not possible as evidenced by the Exchange Visitor s sponsor having requested an extension from the Department of State and such request being

an interested U S Government agency should be evaluated in light of the basic purpose of the Exchange Visitor Program 3 2 8 The project with which the Exchange Visitor is associated must be of such
