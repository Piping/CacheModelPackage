Subject NASA Materials Inventory Management Manual Revalidated 2 9 06 Responsible Office Logistics Management Division Chapter 3 Materials Inventory Control 3 1 Inventory Control Program 3 1 1 In keeping with the policy set forth in paragraph 1 5 of this NPR NASA Centers shall establish and maintain a system to identify document and physically control all items held in inventories i e Stores Stock Program Stock and Standby Stock 3 1 2 Effective controls must be established to prevent the stockpiling of materials outside of the designated Center s materials inventory control system 3 1 3 If an item is considered hazardous material the decision on whether or not to stock it should be based on health potential environmental impact and safety policies The costs and complexities involved in any future excess and disposal processes should also be considered 3 2 Classification of Inventory NASA materials inventories shall be classified under one of the following three codes which define the status of the materials while under inventory control Using activities are permitted to keep on hand a limited amount of materials for day to day operations In the case of Stores Stock type items such quantities should normally not exceed a 60 day supply SEMO are authorized to designate and limit total quantity dollar value of user activity Stores Stock type items to not exceed $ 20 000 3 2 1 Stores Stock Status Code 1 Material being held in inventory by the Center which is repetitively procured stored and issued on the basis of recurring demand 3 2 2 Program Stock Status Code 2 Material acquired by direct purchase or by issue from Stores Stock for a specific program or project To be designated a Program Stock inventory the extended dollar value of the items maintained therein shall exceed $ 75 000 A Program Stock inventory shall be under appropriate Center inventory and financial accounting controls Items not meeting the $ 75 000 criteria may be maintained in a bench stock operation or under other locally determined controls 3 2 3 Standby Stock Status Code 3 Material held for emergencies for which there is no normal recurring demand but that must be immediately available to preclude delay which might result in loss damage or destruction of Government property danger to life or welfare of personnel or substantial financial loss to the Government due to an interruption of operations Standby Stock is not to be used as a repository for items declared excess from Status Codes 1 and 2 or from any other programs 3 3 Inventory Type Accounts 3 3 1 Determination of the appropriate classification of material inventory items shall be based on the Federal Supply Classification Cataloging Handbook H2 1 Note that these types of accounts parallel those found in NASA Financial Management Manual 9254 6 New type accounts shall be approved by the Director Logistics Management Office and the Director Financial Management Division NASA Headquarters 3 3 2 Pricing of Inventories 3 3 2 1 Additions to inventory by purchase will be recorded in general ledger account 1200 at invoice price less trade discounts Cash discounts when taken are credited to the appropriate general ledger cost account 5X10 Transportation handling and storage costs should be included in inventory cost when included on the purchasing document and be readily and distinctly related to the item purchased 3 3 2 2 Additions to inventory by transfer from other NASA Centers other Federal Agencies or from one status code to another will be recorded in general ledger account 1200 at the price actually paid for the material If no payment is made for the material transferred then the material will be recorded at the lower of the net book value of the transferor or the fair market value 3 3 2 3 Items returned to the inventory for credit or without credit will be recorded at the lower of the original issue price or the current issue price Credit shall be allowed only for returns which can be identified to the appropriation and accounting classification coding i e organization program project or functional category of the activity to which the original issue was made Credit shall not be allowed for any issue made prior to the beginning of the previous fiscal year 3 3 2 4 When inventory is replenished through procurement return or transfer a redetermination will be made of the average stock record unit price based on the weighted moving average To do this the value of the received item will be added to the value of the total quantity on hand and the sum will be divided by the total of the received quantity plus the quantity on hand The result is the new unit price 3 4 Materials Inventory Control System Each NASA Center shall establish and maintain a system to control materials inventory that includes the following 3 4 1 A single system for managing Stores Stock inventories shall be established and maintained 3 4 2 Program Stock and or Standby Stock inventory records shall be maintained either at individual supply points under a decentralized system or at one control location for all of the supply points as a centralized or consolidated system Only one set of records shall be maintained All control records shall contain adequate and current descriptive data and shall accurately reflect the status of each item 3 4 3 The control system shall provide for the identification through record coding or through use of detail support records of equipment items designated for support of a repair program when such a program is authorized by the Center The system shall record issues by equipment serial number or similar control and shall identify the issue location 3 4 4 Perpetual control shall be established for all inventories controlled by automatic data processing all high demand items in a manual system and for critical use or security items requiring special attention 3 4 5 Low demand items managed under a manual system may be maintained under periodic control except for critical use or security items requiring special attention 3 4 6 Periodic control inventories shall use a stock record card as the control document No issue data shall be posted to this record 3 4 7 Perpetual inventory control systems shall use individual transaction entries for each action affecting an item Each increase and decrease to stock levels shall be supported by an input or output document or comparable record i e issue ticket receiving report or inventory adjustment voucher 3 4 8 The perpetual inventory control record shall contain data showing the status of all actions affecting the item i e issues receipts due ins due outs and adjustments 3 5 Criteria for Classifying Stores Stock The basic criteria for classifying items as Stores Stock are contained in paragraph 3 2 1 3 5 1 The candidate item for stockage must fall within one of the following categories a Be physically adaptable to storage and issue b Have anticipated demand patterns making reasonably accurate forecasts of requirements possible c Have a shelf life sufficiently long enough to permit stockage without unnecessary loss 3 5 2 Items having recurring demands but not meeting the minimum demand criteria may be carried in Stores Stock if at least one of the following applies a Advance purchase and storage is necessary because of long procurement lead time b An adequate industry distribution system does not exist that would ensure availability c Market conditions are such that an adequate supply can only be ensured through stockage d Volume purchases are necessary to secure timely delivery and advantageous price However the amount of the purchase should not exceed the economic retention limit for the item see paragraph 4 6 4 3 6 Criteria for Classifying Program Stock 3 6 1 Materials meeting the criteria of paragraph 3 2 2 held by any organizational element shall be classified as Program Stock Inventory controls initially shall be established at the direction of the SEMO and shall include an identification of the responsible program or project manager 3 6 2 Items may be added to Program Stock inventory when authorized in writing by a program or project manager or designee Any items added whether by replenishment transfer in or turn in shall be identified to a specific program or project 3 6 3 Equipment items such as line replaceable units or components of major systems or subsystems may be classified as Program Stock when approved for rotation through a repair program or for backup replacement components Such items shall be distinctively tagged or marked to distinguish them from other equipment items managed under NPR 4200 1 NASA Equipment Management Manual Once such items are no longer identified to a repair program or as backup replacement stocks normal controls under NPR 4200 1 shall apply 3 7 Criteria for Classifying Standby Stock Materials which are held to meet the requirements of paragraph 3 2 3 shall be classified as Standby Stock Items shall be added to Standby Stock only upon written justification by a division chief or equivalent 3 8 Physical Inventory of Materials Each stock classification of inventory shall be physically inventoried on a cyclic or sample basis pursuant to the procedures set forth in chapter 5 of this NPR 3 9 Management of Shelf Life Materials Following the guidance in Federal Property Management Regulations subchapter E Subpart 101 27 2 Management of Shelf Life Materials NASA Centers shall develop and implement a program to minimize loss and ensure maximum use of shelf life items prior to their deterioration A shelf life item is any item possessing deteriorative or changeable characteristics so that a storage period must be assigned to that item to assure upon issuance that the item shall perform satisfactorily The SEMO shall establish a program to identify such items establish the expiration dates and control their procurement storage issue and disposal 3 9 1 Types of Shelf Life Items Shelf life items are classified as nonextendible Type I or extendible Type II A Type I item has a finite nonextendible storage life after which the item is considered to be unusable Examples of Type I items are drugs and medicines with certain characteristics A Type II item has an assigned shelf life storage period that may be extended after completion of inspection test or restorative action Examples of Type II items are paint ink tape printing ribbon and photographic film 3 9 2 Shelf Life Codes All shelf life items shall be identified in NASA supply inventory systems bya one digit code alpha or numeric that is uniformly used by all Federal agencies Alpha codes are for nonextendable items and numeric codes are for extendible items 3 9 2 1 The code designators for items with shelf life periods of up to 60 months can be found in the Federal Property Management Regulations subchapter E subpart 101 27 205 3 9 2 2 Code 0 is used to identify items not included in the shelf life program 3 9 2 3 Code X is used to identify critical end use items military essential items and medical items with a shelf life greater than 60 months A critical end use item is any item that is essential to the preservation of life in emergencies or any item essential to the performance of a major system NASA Centers must establish the necessary controls for these items to prevent their issuance in an unserviceable condition 3 9 2 4 Centers may also establish controls for items with a shelf life greater than 60 months that are not identified in paragraph 3 Such controls should be established only when they are necessary for effective management of the items 3 9 3 Procurement of Shelf Life Items In determining requirements of shelf life items the length of storage months of supply and appropriate contracting techniques for the particular item involved including specification requirements industry practices and storage and delivery procedures shall be considered 3 9 4 Identification and Shipping Requirements Manufacturers whenever practicable shall be required to mark the unit or container with the month and year of manufacture or production and the batch number of all shelf life items 60 months or less procured from other than Government supply sources Whenever practical suppliers shall be required to ship or deliver material within a given number of months from the date of manufacture or production These age on delivery requirements should not be imposed in such a manner as to unduly restrict competition at any trade level 3 9 5 Packaging To the extent feasible and economical shelf life materials shall be packaged in such a way to provide for minimum deterioration 3 9 6 Controls and Inspection 3 9 6 1 Centers shall establish the necessary controls to identify shelf life items on supply system records and where applicable on related storage locations and locator records Shelf life items must be stored in a manner to ensure the oldest stock on hand is issued first except where it is not feasible to do so as in shipments to overseas activities 3 9 6 2 Before the end of the designated shelf life period Type II items shall be inspected to determine whether the shelf life period can be extended This inspection criteria does not apply if the shelf life item has a line item inventory value of $ 300 or less or if the cost of inspection and testing is significant in relation to the value of the item If material is found suitable for issuance on the date of inspection the shelf life period should be extended for a period equal to 50 percent of the original shelf life period and the next reinspection date should be established accordingly Upon reinspection the shelf life can be extended again up to 50 percent of the original shelf life as long as the material conforms to the established criteria 3 9 6 3 Extension of shelf life periods based upon inspection of the material shall be documented 3 9 7 Marking When the shelf life period of Type II material containers of bulk stocks except critical end use items is extended only the exterior packaging need indicate the date of inspection and the date material is to be reinspected Individual units of issue not classified as having a critical end use application are not required to be annotated or labeled as long as the supply system maintains identifiable controls to preclude issuance of unserviceable material to a user At the time of issue or shipment the dates of inspection and reinspection must be affixed by a label or marked by other means on each unit of issue for Type II items having a critical end use application 3 9 8 Inventory Analysis 3 9 8 1 Centers must periodically conduct an inventory analysis of shelf life items to determine whether quantities on hand shall be issued within the established shelf life period so that arrangements can be made to ensure local use or redistribution to other Centers or agencies for use Type I shelf life items have a definite storage life When these items cannot be used or redistributed they shall be disposed of according to governing procedures 3 9 8 2 The analysis of Type II items with a shelf life of less than 60 months shall be made as follows Shelf Life Period
