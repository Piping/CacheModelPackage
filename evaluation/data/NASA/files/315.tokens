Center Supply and Equipment Management Officer SEMO c All NASA Centers shall assign to NASA controlled equipment a property identification number or equipment control number to uniquely identify the property item in the PP & E system which will be used to support property accountability and the performance of physical inventories d All NASA Centers shall complete a 100 percent physical inventory of all NASA held equipment each fiscal year and initiate applicable survey reports and found on station FOS reports to resolve discrepancies in the PP & E system before the end of the fiscal year September 30 On this date center statistics will automatically be generated by NASA systems and used in computing the Centers and Agency s inventory record accuracy rate An inventory campaign includes pre inventory planning activities the actual inventory and post inventory reconciliation activities e The Property Survey Report NASA Form NF 598 shall be used for equipment losses both outside of and during the inventory as the supporting documentation for Equipment Managers to adjust the property records 1 For losses outside the inventory Center personnel will initiate applicable supporting documentation and adjustments to the property records independently from inventory campaign activities 2 Center personnel will fully document and report losses discovered during the execution of an inventory with adequate time to allow for timely closure of the inventory campaign 3 The NF 598 also is used by the Survey Review Board SRB to recommend corrective actions and to assess financial liability when applicable Centers will process an NF 598 from initiation to adjudication within 48 business days from initiation date 4 The end user initiates the property survey report NF 598 The end user s supervisor or the person having the most knowledge surrounding the circumstances of the loss initiates the survey report when the end user is not available 5 The person initiating the survey report immediately notifies Center security personnel and the corresponding Property Custodian PC when theft is suspected f The following requirements apply to all equipment loans 1 Loans are processed using NF 893 Loan of NASA Equipment except as provided in section 1g 2 Loan requestors provide a written justification that clearly explains the NASA mission requirement satisfied by the
