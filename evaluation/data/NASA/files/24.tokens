Michael D Griffin Administrator ATTACHMENT A NASA Principles for the Ethnical Care and Use of Animals A 1 Introduction A strong allegiance to the principles of bioethics is vital to any discussion of responsible research practices As reflected in the considerations of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects scientific research has produced substantial social benefits [ and ] some troubling ethical questions The Belmont Report 1979 The Belmont Report identified the key fundamental principles underlying the ethical evaluation of research involving human subjects Similarly the principles governing the ethical evaluation of the use of animals in research must be made equally explicit It is generally agreed that vertebrate animals warrant moral concern The following principles are offered to guide careful and considered discussion of the ethical challenges that arise in the course of animal research a process that must balance risks burdens and benefits NASA will abide by these principles as well as all applicable laws and policies that govern the ethical use of animals It is recognized that awareness of these principles will not prevent conflicts Rather these principles are meant to provide a framework within which challenges can be rationally addressed A 2 Basic Principles The use of animals in research involves responsibility not only for the stewardship of the animals but to the scientific community and society as well Stewardship is a universal responsibility that goes beyond the immediate research needs to include acquisition care and disposition of the animals while responsibility to the scientific community and society requires an appropriate understanding of and sensitivity to scientific needs and community attitudes toward the use of animals Among the basic principles generally accepted in our culture three are particularly relevant to the ethics of research using animals respect for life societal benefit and nonmaleficence A 3 Respect for Life Living creatures deserve respect This principle requires that animals used in research should be of an appropriate species and health status and the research should involve the minimum number of animals required to obtain valid scientific results It also recognizes that the use of different species may raise different ethical concerns Selection of appropriate species should consider cognitive capacity and other morally relevant factors Additionally methods such as mathematical models computer simulation and in vitro systems should be considered and used whenever possible A 4 Societal Benefit The advancement of biological knowledge and the improvements in the protection of the health and well being of both humans and other animals provide strong justification for biomedical and behavioral research This principle entails that in cases where animals are used the assessment of the overall ethical value of such use should include consideration of the full range of potential societal goods the populations affected and the burdens that are expected to be borne by the subjects of the research A 5 Nonmaleficence Vertebrate animals are sentient This principle entails that the minimization of distress pain and suffering is a moral imperative Unless the contrary is established investigators should consider that procedures that cause pain or distress in humans may cause pain or distress in other sentient animals ATTACHMENT B References B1 NPR 1440 1 NASA Records Retention Schedules B2 U S Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service
