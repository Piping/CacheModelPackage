Responsible Office Office of the Chief Information Officer 1 POLICY a NASA s policy is to protect all forms of sensitive unclassified information including personal information b Federal law and regulations require that all personal information collected used maintained and disseminated by or on behalf of this Agency is included whether in electronic or non electronic form c Therefore NASA policy requires that 1 All collections of sensitive unclassified information including personal information as defined in Attachment A of this NPD will be assessed for applicability under managed and appropriately protected in compliance with Federal laws regulations and Government wide policies 2 An Initial Privacy Threshold Analysis IPTA for any new or significantly changed applications Web sites information systems including third party applications and information systems and collections of information provided for by external service providers who are collecting information on behalf of NASA and all non electronic information collections will be accomplished to determine whether there are any privacy implications or other regulatory compliance requirements 3 When initial assessments via the IPTA process calls for the completion of a full Privacy Impact Assessment PIA one will automatically be initiated and must be completed prior to actively collecting any information 4 All collections of personal information gathered by or on behalf of NASA will leverage Agency specific individual identifiers The use of Social Security Numbers SSNs will be avoided to the greatest extent possible In instances where SSNs are already in use collections will be reviewed annually for removal or replacement using other Agency individual identifiers such as the Universal Uniform Personal Identification Code UUPIC The use of SSNs is authorized only when mandated by external or statutory requirements and justified in writing within the associated IPTA or PIA 2 APPLICABILITY a

Administrator ATTACHMENT A TEXT Data Extracts are created when information from a pre existing data source is exported thereby creating a new and separate information collection Information in identifiable form IIF in accordance with section 208 d of the e Gov act IIF is defined as any representation of information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means In accordance with OMB Memorandum M 03 22 IIF is information in an IT system or online collection i that directly identifies an individual e g name address social security number or other identifying number or code telephone number email address etc or ii by which an agency intends to identify specific individuals in conjunction with other data elements i e indirect identification These data elements may include a combination of gender race birth date geographic indicator and other descriptors NASA User is any explicitly authorized patron of a NASA information system The NASA user includes but is not limited to civil servants and contractors Personally identifiable information in accordance with M 07 16 PII refers to information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual s identity such as their name social security number biometric records etc alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual such as date and place of birth mother s maiden name etc In accordance with M 10 23 [ t ] he definition of PII is not anchored to any single category of information or technology Rather it requires a case by case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified In performing this assessment it is important for an agency to recognize that non PII can become PII whenever additional information is made publicly available in any medium and from any source that when combined with other available information could be used to identify an individual For purposes of NASA policy sensitive PII excludes personal information collected and or maintained by NASA employees and contractors for personal rather than NASA business purposes as allowed under NPD 2540 1 Personal Use of Government Office Equipment Including Information Technology Examples of such excluded data include contact information for family relatives and doctors NASA defines PII commensurate with OMB Memoranda M 07 16 and M 10 23 with further definition as it applies to sensitive and non sensitive PII Sensitive PII is well defined above however Non Sensitive PII though it is PII is information that is available through commonly available public sources the disclosure of which cannot reasonably be expected to result in personal harm or embarrassment For the purposes of this policy as it applies to IPTAs and PIAs significant change is defined as any change that constitutes new uses of existing information being collected application of new technologies such as non electronic collection to electronic implementation of persistent tracking technology cookies how information is collected or managed from whom the information is to be collected duration of information retention how the information is being collected e g forms electronic or non electronic or any change to the application system Web site Web application or information collection including change in NASA responsible official information owner or system owner that effects how the information is stored managed and protected Privacy Act Information is any information which is subject to the requirements established by the Privacy Act of 1974 and NASA Privacy Act Regulations 14 Code of Federal Regulations CFR Part 1212 The Privacy Act sets forth extensive requirements for the management of personal information contained in a system of records SOR where such information is routinely retrieved by a name or personal identifier unique to the individual Privacy Information or personal information is any information which falls within the definitions of IIF PII or Privacy Act as described herein Laws regulations and guidance documents provide various terms and definitions used to describe personal or personal information These include personally identifiable information or PII personal information Privacy Act records and
