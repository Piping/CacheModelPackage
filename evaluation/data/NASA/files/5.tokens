1 03 06 2012 Update to comply with 1400 Compliance with administrative changes title changes update applicable documents and added Attachment B for references 2 Correct typo in 5 5 c Director for LSO shall 1 POLICY a It is NASA s policy to Government technical oversight of launch services provided by commercial launch service providers NASA remains accountable for the success of its missions launched with commercially provided launch services since launch remains a high risk element affecting mission success b Commercial launch service providers own and operate launch vehicles and direct administrative and technical tasks associated with the launch services provided to NASA Recognizing that the ownership of commercial launch service technical standards resides with each launch service provider rather than with NASA NASA uses a combination of specified approvals and targeted insight in order to establish apply and modify mission technical requirements identify technical issues and resolve disputes and assess the competency and adequacy of the technical work performed by the commercial launch service providers NASA s technical oversight approach seeks to ensure the successful performance of the launch services for NASA missions c Consistent with the responsibility to ensure the highest practicable probability of launch success NASA shall retain involvement in and control of the launch through a technical oversight approach which combines focused approvals and technical insight of contractor launch activities d For the purposes of this policy Government insight means acquiring knowledge and understanding of contractors actions by the monitoring of selected metrics and or milestones through insight documentation review meeting attendance reviews tests and compliance evaluations NASA retains the ability to nonconcur with a contractor s proposed actions for a NASA launch service based upon knowledge obtained during insight activities consistent with Section 5 c 2 below e For the purposes of this policy Government approval entails providing the launch service contractor formally documented authority to proceed and or formal acceptance of requirements plans tests or success criteria in specified areas 2 APPLICABILITY This NPD is applicable to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers including Component Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers This language applies to Jet Propulsion Laboratory a Federally Funded Research and Development Center other contractors grant recipients or parties to agreements only to the extent specified or referenced in the appropriate contracts grants or agreements NASA launches identified through the Flight Planning Board FPB process as able to tolerate higher risk launch services as defined in NPD 8610 7 may utilize a modified technical oversight approach Suborbital missions high risk tolerance are exempt from this technical oversight policy Application of this approach to launches purchased under spacecraft contracts for on orbit services or other innovative contractual arrangements will be reviewed by the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate HEOMD and sponsoring Mission Directorate on a case by case basis and approved through the Flight Planning Board process well in advance of contract action 3 AUTHORITY The National Aeronautics and Space Act as amended 51 U S C ยง 20113 4 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS AND FORMS a NPD 1280 1 NASA Management System Policy b NPD 8610 7 Launch Services Risk Mitigation Policy for NASA Owned or NASA Sponsored Payloads Missions c NPR 7120 5 NASA Program and Project Management Processes and Requirements d NPR 8715 3 NASA Safety Manual 5 RESPONSIBILITY a The HEOMD Associate Administrator AA shall be responsible for the NASA Launch Services Program LSP and provides necessary resources to support implementation of this policy b The Director for Launch Services Office LSO as delegated by the AA of HEOMD is responsible for the following 1 Assessing LSP implementation consistent with this policy directive 2 Documenting approved exceptions waivers and deviations to the LSP technical oversight approach for specific missions at a FPB 3 Reviewing and coordinating any reduced technical oversight approach with the General Counsel to assess applicability of Federal Aviation Administration FAA launch licensing authority 4 Assessing the applicability of this technical oversight approach to on orbit service acquisitions or other innovative contractual approaches for launch in advance of contract award in coordination with the NASA Chief Engineer affected Mission Directorate and the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance 5 Coordinating through the FPB policy guidance on balancing NASA Risk Mitigation Policy NPD 8610 7 with Technical Oversight Policy to enable mission unique tailoring for individual missions classes of missions prior to contract award c The LSP Manager reporting to the Director for LSO shall be responsible for the following 1 Resolving technical issues that arise due to competition among mission requirements cost and schedule and best technical practices in the following manner a The LSP Manager ensures that all relevant and reasonable technical issues are properly identified competently addressed and coordinated with the spacecraft customer b If the LSP Manager is unable to satisfactorily resolve technical issues and cannot reach consensus with the spacecraft customer on a resolution path then the LSP Manager shall elevate those issues to the HEOMD The HEOMD Director for LSO will coordinate with the affected spacecraft Mission Directorate the Office of the Chief Engineer the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance and other Headquarters offices as appropriate to consider cost schedule and performance issues affected by the technical issue The HEOMD will seek to reach consensus but retains authority for risk acceptance of technical launch vehicle issues as they affect HEOMD s responsibility for assuring launch mission success 2 Assuring that all NASA launch service contracts a Include the Government s approval and insight requirements and rights as outlined in Attachment A to this policy directive b Permit independent verification validation assessment by NASA of selected critical mission analyses procedures processes tests and acceptance criteria to obtain the maximum practicable probability of launch success c Permit approval by NASA of all mission unique analyses spacecraft to launch vehicle interfaces designs and test procedures d Permit substantial involvement in control of and final approval by NASA for the final go for launch decision e Identify contractor assurance activities and permit NASA assurance activities including verification of contractor implementation of assurance activities through a formal NASA Safety and Mission Assurance process f Protect the safety of the public the workforce and property comply with all applicable statutory and regulatory environmental requirements and preserve the national security as well as foreign policy interests from risks attendant with a Government launch g Provide in accordance with NPR 7120 5 for the safety and mission success of the launch portion of any payload mission utilizing launch services acquired and managed by LSP and governed by this policy h Identify and arrange requisite assets to assure telemetry data is provided for all launch vehicle powered flight events for every NASA LSP launch Real time telemetry for all vehicle powered flight events is desirable however receive and record is mandatory d The AA for each Mission Directorate shall be responsible for assuring that any proposed deviations to this policy are brought to the attention of the Director for LSO and resolved through the FPB process 6 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY None 7 MEASUREMENTS VERIFICATION a Compliance with this NPD will be evaluated on a continuing basis by the HEOMD Director for LSO in coordination with the LSP Manager b The LSP Manager shall maintain a record of lessons learned and NASA contributions to mission success as a result of NASA technical oversight after each NASA acquired launch 8 CANCELLATION NPD 8610 23C Technical Oversight of Expendable Launch Vehicle ELV Launch Services dated April 18 2006 REVALIDATED 3 6 12
