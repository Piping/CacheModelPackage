Subject NASA Health and Medical Policy for Human Space Exploration Responsible Office Office of the Chief Health & Medical Officer 1 POLICY It is NASA s policy to a Provide a healthy and safe environment for crewmembers to enable successful human space exploration b Provide health and medical care systems for crewmembers for all mission phases prior during and after space flights Note Health is defined as encompassing physiological psychological and dental well being Medical refers to the treatment of illness and injury c Update crewmember health and medical services based on best supporting evidence and current standards of medical practice lessons learned risk management and expert recommendations d Design initial and recurrent health and medical training for crewmembers consistent with mission requirements and commensurate with available resources and priorities e Establish space flight health and medical standards that address 1 Health and medical screening evaluation and certification including medical selection and retention standards 2 Health and medical diagnosis intervention and care including management and training 3 Health maintenance preventive programs and countermeasures including permissible exposure limits permissible outcome limits and fitness for duty standards 4 Habitability environmental health planetary protection considerations and human performance guidelines and standards as appropriate f Sponsor health and medical clinical research to enable human space exploration 2 APPLICABILITY This NASA Policy Directive NPD is applicable

requirements to ensure coordination with existing NASA planetary protection policy b The Associate Administrator for the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate shall 1 Formulate Directorate level requirements for Exploration Systems including health related and medical requirements based on Agency level exploration requirements and NASA standards 2 Develop and mature targeted human health and medical research and technologies aimed at enabling sustained and affordable human and robotic exploration to an appropriate stage of readiness level for final review approval and implementation 3 Manage flight crew health and safety to include the following a Implementation of crew health and medical care systems b Compliance with health and medical requirements c Management of in flight research activities d Crew participation in in flight research as appropriate e Integration of and use of CHMO approved health and medical technologies for extravehicular and intravehicular activity c The Deputy Chief Technologist shall be responsible for integrating coordinating and tracking the technology investments across the Agency including the mission focused investments e g NASA health medical and performance technologies made by the NASA mission directorates d The Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate or the designee for planetary protection shall be responsible for coordinating with the CHMO regarding health and medical issues related to planetary protection for human space exploration 6 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY None 7
