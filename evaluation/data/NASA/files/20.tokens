Subject Astronaut Medical and Dental Observation Study and Care Program Responsible Office Office of the Chief Health & Medical Officer 1 POLICY The following shall be NASA s policy regarding the medical and dental care of the astronaut corps a The immediate and long term responsibilities of NASA with regard to the human space flight program require that the Agency provide medical and dental care observation and study to astronauts payload specialists and other space flight participants while they are on active duty with NASA Biomedical evidence from clinical and research observations conducted during and following space flight indicates astronauts are at higher risk for some specifically identified medical problems for example intracranial hypertension loss of visual acuity accelerated osteoporosis and injuries related to space suit operations Our findings are evolving as we gain more insight into how humans are affected by space flight To provide adequate health care and monitoring astronauts will be offered full medical care for space flight identified health care issues This care observation to include health monitoring and study will be provided utilizing the best current guidelines for the clinical practice of medicine and dentistry and will be comprehensive in scope as applicable to the NASA mission It will encompass all aspects related to the mission including certification and training and will include all space flight mission phases pre in and post flight It will also provide a program of longitudinal health study including current and retired astronauts payload specialists and other space flight participants b The health of family members of those crewmembers who remain eligible for space flight assignment is of critical importance and factors such as infectious disease and stress affecting a crewmember s family may have serious adverse effects on the crewmember s health and performance as well as the health and performance of other crewmembers Limited outpatient medical care on a diagnosis and referral basis will be provided by Johnson Space Center JSC onsite flight medicine clinics to the crewmember s immediate family as long as the crewmember is eligible for assignment to a space flight mission c Medical and dental insurance are available for current or active duty United States U S astronauts payload specialists and other space flight participants NASA will pay for health care costs of crewmembers eligible for space flight assignment not covered under the individual s insurance plan when the individual is referred by a NASA medical or dental officer and the referral is required for space flight eligibility d Consistent with agreements between NASA and the International Partners NASA will provide astronauts and payload specialists from the international community while they are on active duty and eligible for space flightassignment in the U S the same level of medical care observation and study provided to the U S astronauts and payload specialists e Astronauts payload specialists and other space flight participants may voluntarily participate as subjects in biomedical research during space flight missions provided their participation is supervised by a NASA physician and the research complies with and is in accordance with NPD 7100 8D Protection of Human Research Subjects All human experimental and research data records and health information management system records compiled pursuant to this NPD are subject to 5 U S C 552a Privacy Act of 1974 as amended and NPR 1382 1

monitoring of this NPD to include conducting periodic reviews of its implementation b The Associate Administrator AA Space Operations Mission Directorate is responsible for ensuring that this NPD is implemented and that necessary status reports will be provided to the CHMO and will include the data in support of the metrics outlined in Section 7 Measurements c The NASA Medical Policy Board is responsible for providing policy guidance regarding this program and for any recommendations regarding changes to this NPD to the NASA CHMO d The Center Director JSC is responsible for developing and implementing an Astronaut Medical and Dental Care Observation and Study Program consistent with the policies set forth in this NPD e Directors of other NASA Centers and other NASA officials shall provide support to this program as required 6 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY 7 MEASUREMENT VERFICIATION a METRIC The percentage of NASA Centers responding positively to survey questions 1 The CHMO shall conduct an annual survey of the health care delivery systems of each Center responsible for astronaut medical care to ascertain whether appropriate Center personnel are cognizant of this NPD and an implementation plan is in place The higher the percentage of compliance the greater the success of the program b METRIC The percentage of active duty U S astronauts payload specialists and other space flight participants with medical and dental insurance The AA Space Operations Mission Directorate and Director Space and Life Sciences at JSC shall conduct an annual survey to ascertain the medical and dental insurance status of each active duty astronaut and payload specialist The higher the percentage of active duty astronauts and payload specialists with medical and dental insurance the greater the success of the program c METRIC The number of retired astronauts who receive an annual physical examination as part of the Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health LSAH Program as compared to the total number of retired astronauts available expressed as a percentage 1 The CHMO will conduct an annual assessment of the LSAH to identify the percentage of retired astronauts who receive an annual physical examination as compared to the total number of retired astronauts The higher the percentage of retired astronauts receiving an annual physical examination the greater the success of the program 8 CANCELLATION NPD 8900 3G Astronaut Medical and Dental Observation Study and Care Program dated January 8 2003 s Charles F Bolden Jr Administrator A 1 5 U S C 552a Privacy Act
