Centers This language applies to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory a Federally Funded Research and Development Center other contractors grant recipients or parties to agreements only to the extent specified or referenced in the appropriate contracts grants or agreements b Paragraph 1 a 3 above does not apply to NASA acquisition contracts and Center institutional service contracts initiated prior to promulgation of this NPD Retroactive application of this policy to existing contracts is at the discretion of the applicable NASA program manager or Center Director based on an evaluation of risk related to the retention of previously existing requirements versus implementation of this NPD revision c Waivers to the requirements of this NPD are to be processed in accordance with NASA STD

requirements of this NPD 2 Designate a responsible Center with delegated Metrology and Calibration Program responsibilities Delegated responsibilities include development of policy and procedural requirements issuance of guidance documents and deployment of tools resources facilitating Center Metrology and Calibration Program implementation 3 Authorize the charter and resources for the NASA Metrology and Calibration Working Group MCWG The MCWG serves as a collaborative forum for the development of Agency requirements guidance and tools for effective metrology calibration program implementation b Center Directors shall 1 Establish implement and monitor metrology and calibration requirements to implement the policy provided in paragraph 1 of this NPD for Center institutional functions delineated in Attachment A of this NPD 2 Provide institutional support for program project manager implementation of this NPD at their respective NASA Centers and component facilities 3 Designate a qualified representative to the NASA MCWG to provide Center representation and input at MCWG meetings workshops and other designated activities 4 Provide for managerial oversight and documentation of Center measurement control processes including the management of MTE calibration intervals and related recall programs c Program project managers shall 1 Establish implement and monitor metrology and calibration requirements to implement the policy provided in paragraph 1 of this NPD for program project management functions delineated in Attachment A of this NPD 2 Coordinate metrology and calibration efforts among Centers component facilities and other locations providing program project support 6 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY None 7 MEASUREMENT VERIFICATION Compliance with the requirements contained in this NPD is continuously monitored by the Centers and by the SMA Technical Authority Compliance may also be verified as part of selected cycle reviews and by assessments reviews and audits of the requirements and processes defined within this NPD 8 CANCELLATION NPD 8730 1B Metrology and Calibration dated April 29 2004 Updated with change 2 dated 05 19 2016 ORIGINAL SIGN BY Charles F Bolden Jr Administrator ATTACHMENT A Functions and Conditions Requiring Measurement Controls A 1 Testing qualification certification and or acceptance measurements of flight hardware ground support equipment test systems or other flight related products A 2 Measurements essential to the safety of personnel and the public or for the protection of Government or private property including hazardous and or critical applications A 3 Operation of telecommunications and transmission systems where exact signal interfaces and circuit confirmations are essential to mission success A 4 Research and technology development see NPR 7120 8 manufacturing inspection testing operations maintenance support or other applications where the accuracy of measurements is essential to achieve mission success A 5 NASA publications or other documents released for external review whose conclusions recommendations depend upon the accuracy of measurement results and that impact the safety or success of NASA missions Excluded are preliminary research papers and research instruments under development that have not had traceable units of measurement established A 6 Physical measurements used to apportion levy or otherwise assign cost s or ensure local State or Federal regulatory compliance ATTACHMENT B Clarifications Modifications and Guidance for Calibration Standards B 1 The term customer when used in a calibration standard means the NASA Center and or program organization that receives calibration or testing services B 2 End of period reliability EOPR values equal to or greater than 89 percent are considered acceptable evidence of compliance to ANSI NCSL Z540 3 subclause 5 3 b false acceptance requirements and subclause 5 3 3 measurement uncertainty requirements where such values are derived from statistically significant empirical data B 3 Original equipment manufacturers OEM may provide proprietary calibrations for their MTE In such cases the OEM should provide evidence of traceability and documented test data B 4 Guidance concerning estimation and evaluation of measurement decision risk including false accept risk is provided in NASA HDBK 8739 19 4 Estimation and Evaluation of Measurement Decision Risk and in the NCSLI Handbook for the Application of ANSI NCSL Z540 3 2006 Requirements for the Calibration of Measuring and Test Equipment B 5 Guidance and methods for controlling the accuracy of measurement results are provided in the NASA HDBK 8739 19 series of measurement handbooks The handbooks are found at http www hq nasa gov office
