Subject Administration of Property in the Custody of Contractors Responsible Office Logistics Management Division 1 POLICY a It is NASA Policy to ensure the continued availability and most effective use of NASA Government property GP assets in support of its programs and projects Effective use of GP entails appropriate management of that property throughout the life of the contract and from planning through disposition of the property Effective management ensures that the resources required for performance of NASA programs and projects are available when needed and in appropriate form and quantity and that they are acquired stored maintained used and dispositioned in the most cost effective manner in accordance with law and regulation b NASA activities shall not provide GP to contractors unless the responsible Contracting Officer CO determines it to be in the best interest of the Government and approves the action This includes furnishing existing GP to contractors and allowing the acquisition of property by contractors when that property will become titled to the Government under the Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR in particular the Government Property clause FAR 52 245 1 and the acquired property is not a deliverable item or part thereof c When NASA property is provided for use outside of a NASA Center or Installation it is considered Government Provided Property GPP and NASA will rely on contractors to be responsible for the stewardship of that property This includes property acquired by the contractor when that property is titled to the Government under the Government Property clause or under contract financing provisions d It is NASA policy that property administration programs provide for regular review of contractor performance in the management and stewardship of property in their custody e NASA maintains fiduciary or financial records of GP for statutory compliance and financial reporting However this does not eliminate the requirement for contractors to maintain property records for property in their custody under their property management system PMS and as part of their property stewardship responsibilities f To avoid unnecessary costs associated with duplication of effort contractors performing outside of NASA Centers and Installations are required by contract to record GP in existing corporate property systems and to manage property using corporate plans procedures practices and standards NASA projects programs and mission support activities shall not attempt to reduce or remove this requirement g NASA contracts shall require contractors to use and manage property according to NASA policy and procedural requirements when they perform within the physical confines of a NASA Center or Installation Such property shall be considered Installation Accountable Government Property IAGP 1 When NASA internal GP record systems are available IAGP being used by contractors shall be recorded and managed within those systems 2 To eliminate unnecessary costs duplication of records and reports shall not be required 3 When internal GP record systems are unavailable or when property does not meet the criteria for internal NASA recordkeeping property used by contractors shall be recorded in the contractor s property management recordkeeping system s in accordance with the requirements of the contract and their property management standards systems and practices h NASA will allow contractors when performing within their own facilities to follow industry leading practices and standards ILP & S voluntary consensus standards VCS or customary commercial practices CCP for the stewardship and management of GP to the extent that ILP & S VCS and CCP exist and are adequate for the management of property under the contract s circumstances NASA officials should not impose additional GP management recordkeeping or reporting requirements on contractors when those contractors perform within their own facilities and the requirements would create a NASA unique requirement and result in increased administrative costs to the Agency through duplication of contractor records systems processes or work effort 1 Additional requirements shall be imposed only to meet justified program objectives or to ensure the safety of personnel and property i All facets of GP management require the highest degree of ethical standards to be applied by both Government and contractor personnel 2 APPLICABILITY a This NASA Procedural Directive NPD is applicable to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers including
