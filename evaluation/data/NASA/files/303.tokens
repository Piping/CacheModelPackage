may request the detail of military personnel from the military services to perform appropriate services for NASA b Military detailees are primarily intended to provide a unique resource of capability and experience not otherwise readily available to NASA In addition military detailees may also provide a vital link in the cross flow of scientific technical and programmatic information between NASA and the parent service c In view of these considerations a military detailee position will 1 Require specialized qualifications and skills acquired in the military services that will benefit NASA in the discharge of its statutory functions and at the same time provide the detailee with training and or experience to enhance the detailee s military career and benefit the parent service upon return 2 Focus on engineering technical management medical program management physical or life sciences or flight crew assignments Requests for exceptions to these general provisions will be considered only when justified to meet unusual needs d Military personnel will not be requested for positions in functional areas in which substantial direct support currently is being provided by the Department of Defense DoD under an agreement for such service or that can be more effectively supported through the negotiations of a new direct support agreement e Significant changes will not be made in the duties of a detailee outside the approved position description or the permanent duty station of a detailee without obtaining approval of the parent service through the Director Export Control and Interagency Liaison Division Office of International and Interagency Relations OIIR f Unless otherwise agreed reimbursement for each detailee will be funded by the assigned duty organization and organizations requesting detailee positions will certify the availability of funds for reimbursement for an incumbent of the desired grade in the letter of request for position approval g A support agreement will be put in place between the requesting and supporting organizations detailing the terms of support job responsibilities assignment duration and terms of reimbursement constant with guidance herein 2 Applicability a This NPD applies to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers including Component Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers b The provisions of this NPD relate to the detailing of military personnel to NASA under the terms of the NASA DoD agreements cited in paragraph 4 They do not relate to military personnel temporarily assigned to NASA to serve in a liaison or observer capacity or to perform other functions for the DoD c In this directive all document citations are assumed to be the latest version unless otherwise noted d In this directive all mandatory

the Director Export Control and Interagency Liaison Division OIIR 6 Personnel requirements for nonastronauts will be planned by supervisors on the basis that military detailees will return to the parent service upon completion of a tour of up to 3 years Only in very exceptional cases in which it can be clearly established that because of uncompleted work on a specific project that the loss of the detailee would be seriously detrimental will an extension be requested The agreement and memorandum of understanding listed in paragraph 4 specify that extension of periods of detail up to 1 year may be made and it is expected that requests for further extensions will not be required It is incumbent upon NASA supervisors to anticipate tour completions for detailees and to provide for timely
