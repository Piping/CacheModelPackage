Subject Equipment Management Manual for Property Custodians w Change 1 9 11 03 Responsible Office Logistics Management Division Chapter 3 Control Documentation and Alternate Options for Processing Transactions 3 1 NASA Equipment Management System NEMS Transaction Document NASA Form 1602 Transactions may be processed utilizing the NASA Form 1602 paper document or any electronic means available at the Center The NASA Form 1602 and several electronic methods are described as follows 3 1 1 Purpose and Use 3 1 1 1 The NASA Form 1602 is a NASA form which is used to reflect NASA s equipment information contained in the NEMS data base Hence this form serves as the property custodian s detailed record for each assigned controlled item 3 1 1 2 The custodian maintains the complete four part document until the status of the equipment changes When an action is initiated the custodian holds the suspense copy and forwards the rest of the form to the NEMS Equipment Manager for processing Copy 2 may be given to Transportation when the action involves movement of the item if this is Center policy Copy 3 is held by the gaining custodian when accountability is transferred Copy 1 is used by NEMS Control to update the NEMS data base 3 1 1 3 If a NASA Form 1602 is lost damaged or destroyed the custodian should generate or obtain a replacement copy of the form 3 1 2 Sample Form The NASA FORM 1602 is a computer generated form containing integral data elements extracted from the NEMS data base and transaction approval and signature blocks see figure 1 3 1 3 Characteristics of NASA Form 1602 3 1 3 1 Instructions for use are on the reverse side of the suspense copy of the form 3 1 3 2 Transactions are initiated by checking the appropriate boxes s in the right hand column and by following instructions for blocks 31 to 34 3 1 3 3 Data in blocks 1 through 28 and 36 through 38 are always computer generated Any changes submitted for blocks 1 through 28 should be annotated in block 33 Remarks blocks 36 through 38 reflect data from the last transaction processed entry reference number and transaction name for reference purposes Block 39 is annotated manually in NEMS Control at the time a new transaction is processed When a transaction has been completed the new entry reference number that was noted in block 39 becomes the block 36 entry reference number on a newly generated NASA Form 1602 and forwarded to the custodian FIGURE 1 3 1 3 4 NEMS Control may need to make a correction to an equipment record which could generate a new NASA Form 1602 for the custodian Therefore it is possible for the custodian to receive more than one NASA Form 1602 for the same item at the same time The custodian can identify the most current form to be filed by reviewing the Entry Reference Number ERN The ERN is 10 positions consisting of Positions 1 2 Center number See Appendix I Positions 3 6 Julian date year and day Note The year in position 3 represents years 1984 through 1993 as well as 1994 to present year Position 7 Year 1994 to present Positions 8 10 Sequence number assigned each transaction processed by NEMS Control starting each day with 001 3 1 3 5 If a custodian receives two NASA Form 1602 s for the same item one with an entry reference number of 0172557013 and the other with 0172557022 the latter entry reference number is the most current 3 1 3 6 blocks 1 8 9 10 11 and 12 are outlined to easily identify the equipment control number accountable property custodian organization mail stop and location 3 1 3 7 The equipment control number 1 cost 3 Federal Supply Class 7 manufacturer s name 13 model number 14 serial number 15 and date NASA acquired 17 should only be changed by a custodian if erroneous data are suspected in these fields The custodian should discuss possible errors with the NEMS Equipment Manager for verification prior to submittal of record changes Transactions 60 3 1 3 8 Supporting NASA information may be recorded in block 24 local data NEMS Control will use this field to record data critical to the identification and tracking of an item or to supplement NASA information on a transaction Custodians may request or provide NASA information such as equipment characteristics and document and shipping numbers for input to the local data field 3 2 NEMS Subsystem Property Custodian Module The NEMS Property Custodian Module is designed as an extension of NEMS that provides an interface to approve equipment status by Electronic Signatures of the property custodian and or the NEMS Equipment Manager The custodians are able to process online changes to equipment within their accounts that primarily deal with equipment ownership Access to the NEMS Property Custodian Module automatically allows access to the NEMS for inquiry purposes 3 2 1 The use of the NEMS Property Custodian Module is strongly encouraged because it significantly reduces paperwork required for NASA Form 1602 processing 3 2 2 Contact your Center s NEMS Equipment Manager for details on obtaining access to the module a copy of these procedures and guidelines and training 3 3 Electronic Mail Processing Custodian transfer and user changes can be initiated via electronic mail Your password to access electronic mail is considered your signature However electronic mail is not a secure medium and transmissions should be validated through other available means such as telephone calls or personal visits with the requester 3 3 1 User Changes Electronic mail a message to the new user listing the Equipment Control Number s and Item Name s that will be assigned to their name Request that the new user concur on your electronic mail message and forward it to the NEMS Equipment Manager with a copy to the initiator NEMS Control will use the electronic mail message as the source document to process the requested change 3 3 2 Property custodian transfer Use the process described in 3 3 3 3 3 Property custodian transfer requiring a user change The losing custodian will electronic mail a message to the gaining custodian using the process described in 3 3 The gaining custodian will concur with the transfer on the electronic mail message and forward it to the gaining user The concurrence of the gaining user will be added to the message that is forwarded to the NEMS Equipment Manager with copies to the losing and gaining custodians 3 4 Internet Contact your local Property Management Office for available processes
