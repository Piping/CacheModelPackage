Update with 1400 compliance and administrative changes title changes and corrected authority 1 Policy a It is NASA s policy for the initiation and development of international cooperation in space and aeronautical programs 1 NASA encourages mutually beneficial foreign participation in its programs projects and activities when such participation is appropriate and significantly enhances technical scientific economic or foreign policy benefits Exploratory discussions with prospective foreign partners are encouraged However Agency commitments to proceed with a potential cooperative effort will not be made or implied prior to full coordination and approval of a proposed joint effort 2 Proposals for international cooperation are encouraged both during project planning and after project approval Such proposals may relate to foreign participation in NASA activities or to NASA participation in foreign activities as well as joint international collaborative efforts 3 Because space and aeronautical research projects generally require long lead times are technically and scientifically challenging and involve major investments of resources and because NASA is a Government agency NASA s counterparts will generally be foreign government agencies rather than foreign universities or private organizations 4 Technical and scientific projects must merit support as contributions to NASA programmatic objectives Projects will be within the known scientific technical and budgetary capabilities of the cooperating partners Each partner is to assume full financial responsibility for its own commitments although the respective contributions of the cooperating partners need not be equivalent 5 To minimize complexity the division of responsibilities between NASA and the cooperating partner should be clearly defined 6 Arrangements for cooperative activities will take into consideration the need to protect against the unwarranted transfer of technology abroad in accordance with U S export laws and regulations Issues related to U S industrial competitiveness will also be considered in developing cooperative activities 7 Each cooperative activity will demonstrate a specific benefit to NASA and the United States Such benefit may be in the form of data services or contribution to flight mission or operational infrastructure systems or it may directly support broader U S policy or interests Science projects will include a commitment to make any scientific results available to the international scientific community as soon as possible 8 Each cooperative activity will be established in a formal written and signed international agreement which specifically states the responsibilities of each partner General agreements that establish intent to explore and facilitate cooperation may be necessary under exceptional circumstances However commitment by the Agency to cooperate in a specific research or flight project is only made in a project specific agreement after full coordination and approval of the proposed joint project 2 Applicability a This Directive applies to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers including Component Facilities and Technical and Service
