Directive revalidated to include administrative changes 1 POLICY a It is NASA s policy to provide baseline capabilities that meet requirements consistent with all applicable laws national level directives and Agency requirements for responding to and effectively managing emergencies Such baseline capabilities are to be continually maintained to mitigate crises with a capabilities based approach using one comprehensive plan coupled with incident specific responses in the form of annexes for the range of adverse events This prevents a fixation on any one threat or hazard This concept is known as the all hazards concept b Target levels of baseline capabilities will balance the potential threat and magnitude of terrorist attacks major disasters and other emergencies with the resources required to prevent respond to and recover from them This all hazards decision framework will prioritize and optimize investments based on needs to maintain readiness response and recovery capabilities This will be accomplished by performing the following actions 1 Developing implementing maintaining and updating comprehensive and integrated emergency preparedness plans including specific information for employees with disabilities at all NASA Centers and Component Facilities using a multiyear strategy and program management process and a designated operating structure compliant with the National Incident Management System 2 Developing implementing maintaining and updating a full spectrum of redundant and interoperable communications capabilities for use during an emergency to include both secure and non secure voice and data connectivity internet access and electronic mailing This capability shall include the use of mandated systems and software as required at the Federal level 3 Developing implementing and maintaining a test training and exercise program that demonstrates assesses and improves the ability to execute emergency plans at all NASA Centers and Component Facilities using a three year planning calendar This program shall include an education and awareness component designed to meet national mandates and solicit the support and involvement of all personnel 4 Establishing and maintaining relationships with Federal state and local agencies that support interagency operations under national and regional emergency management plans and operations 5 Establishing and maintaining internal safety and health relationships in support of emergency readiness response and recovery across the Agency 2 APPLICABILITY a This NPD applies to NASA Headquarters HQ and NASA Centers including Component Facilities Jet Propulsion Laboratory a Federally Funded Research and Development Center and contractors to the extent specified in its contract 3

that may be local national or international in scope as requested through authorized channels 2 The NASA Emergency Management Program includes hazard specific risk assessments target baseline capabilities program objectives and emergency operating plans for all organizational elements of the Agency Organizational elements will provide funding for these purposes b The Assistant Administrator AA Office of Protective Services OPS is designated as the senior policy official responsible for the NASA Emergency Management Program The AA of OPS shall ensure the following 1 The NASA Emergency Management Program is effectively implemented including designation of a NASA Chief Emergency Management Program Manager EPPM 2 Emergency management plans including interagency and individual Center plans involving NASA activity are coordinated with appropriate NASA organizational elements c The NASA Chief EPPM shall 1 Provide emergency management program administration management advocacy and expertise in planning and operations 2 Function as the point of contact to liaise with the Department of Homeland Security Federal Emergency Management Agency other Federal organizations and Multi Agency Coordinating Groups in support of the National Response Plan and other emergency management plans involving NASA activity ensuring such plans are coordinated with appropriate NASA organizational elements and providing the appropriate Federal organization with NASA s position concerning such plans and operations 3 Provide technical advice and assistance including training for Agency and Center senior staff emergency management teams and Center Emergency Management Program Managers 4 Conduct continual review of emergency management readiness throughout NASA to assess proficiency and effective use of resources 5 Develop plan prepare coordinate and maintain a National Security Emergency Management Program designed for the continuity of mission essential operations d The Associate Administrator for Institutions and Management and Center Directors shall support the NASA Emergency Management Program and allocate necessary funding for implementation of Center and Component Facility specific emergency readiness response and recovery programs e Other Officials in Charge of Headquarters Offices shall ensure their organization s support of the NASA Emergency Management Program by providing functional expertise during planning activities and emergency operations f NASA Center Directors must ensure that the NASA Emergency Management Program is effectively implemented at their respective Centers and Component Facilities and shall 1 Designate a Center EPPM supported by trained and prepared emergency management teams 2 Annually review and approve Center specific emergency management plans that are developed implemented and maintained to respond to mitigate and recover from all hazard emergencies 3 Provide assistance in accordance with Center Director approved mutual aid agreements entered into and outlining coordination of emergency management resources for mutual response to emergencies occurring within their jurisdictions 4 Designate representatives to state regional and local emergency management committees and work groups to ensure thorough preparedness during potential interagency emergency operations 5 The NASA Chief EPPM or HQ Emergency Operations Center when operational shall be notified of NASA personnel or resources deployed to regional state or local emergency operations during actual emergencies 6 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY None 7 MEASUREMENT VERIFICATION a In assessing whether NASA complies with current regulations the NASA Office of Protective Services shall do the following 1 Utilize the Emergency Management section of the Protective Services Self Assessment Checklist to assess emergency management response and readiness at Centers and Component Facilities 2 Ensure the assessment focuses on evaluating Center emergency management programs plans and procedures and establish a baseline for demonstrating the extent to which a Center will implement test and train personnel under their emergency management plans and procedures 3 Have each Center submit a memorandum reporting that their Plan s have been reviewed their emergency response procedures are current and provide copies to the AA for the OPS no later than September 30 of each year 4 Supplemental metrics and reporting requirements may be developed and implemented depending upon internal external mandates 8 CANCELLATION NPD 8710 1D Emergency Preparedness Program dated November 8 2006 Revalidated August 26 2011 Original Signed by s Michael D Griffin
