Subject Design and Construction of Facilities Responsible Office Facilities Engineering and Real Property Division 1 POLICY a It is NASA s policy to retain only those facilities required to conduct NASA programs maintain the Agency s core capabilities and meet national responsibilities b It is NASA s policy to purchase construct and or operate new real property only when existing capabilities including those owned by NASA and other external entities cannot be used or modified cost effectively New facilities and additions to existing facilities are to be offset by a greater than equivalent amount of facility disposal c It is NASA s policy that facilities built and operated to support NASA s mission be planned budgeted designed and constructed in compliance with current Federal laws and regulations d It is NASA s policy that industry best practices of sustainable design maintainable design building commissioning and safety and security be incorporated into the planning and execution of facility projects The use of these practices ensures that facility projects are delivered with the most economical life cycle cost least environmental impact and maximum benefits in occupants health safety security and productivity e It is NASA s policy that design and construction activities ensure that project decisions include appropriate features to safeguard the health and welfare of facility visitors occupants and equipment against internal hazards or external dangers 2 APPLICABILITY a This NPD is applicable to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers including component facilities and
