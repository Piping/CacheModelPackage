ATTACHMENT A TEXT Consumable Items Materials that are used and consumed during assembly integration test operation and maintenance of a system Examples include but are not limited to wipes tie wraps fluids safety wire adhesives and lubricants Industrial Base The capabilities residing in either the commercial or Government sector required to design develop manufacture launch and service the program or project This encompasses related manufacturing facilities supply chain operations and management a skilled workforce launch infrastructure research and development and support services Integrated Logistics Support ILS adapted from DoD Acquisition Community Connection A discipline associated with the design development test production fielding sustainment improvement modifications and disposal of cost effective systems The principal objectives of ILS are to ensure that support considerations are an integral part of a system s design requirements that the system can be cost effectively supported through its life cycle and that the infrastructure elements necessary to the initial fielding and operational support of the system are identified developed and acquired Since the majority of a system s life cycle costs can be attributed directly to operations and support costs it is vitally important that system developers evaluate the potential operation and support costs of alternate designs and factor these into early design decisions ILS activities are most effective when they are integral to both the contractor and Government s system engineering technical and management processes The recognized elements of ILS include a Design Interface participating in the design process to enhance system supportability b Supply Support d Packaging Handling Storage and Transportation PHS & T e Technical Data f Support and Test Equipment g Training and Training Support h Manpower and Personnel for ILS Functions i Facilities Required for ILS Functions j Computer
