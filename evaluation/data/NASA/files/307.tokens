Agency Required Training A 1 As a continuous learning Agency NASA must ensure the optimal alignment of training to meet the objectives of the Agency s mission Given the size of NASA s workforce any training requirement poses a significant organizational cost A systematic approach to the establishment of training requirements requires a consistent approval implementation and communication process In so doing this ensures that the investment of employee time and resources to training is maximized A 2 OHCM has developed a Standard Operating Procedure SOP on Federally Mandated Training to provide clarity and structure to the process of evaluating developing and communicating federally mandated training This guidance is designed to ensure that mandatory training is established in accordance with training laws and regulations including frequency duration and content A 3 The Office of Personnel Management OPM Training Policy Handbook defines Federally mandated training as Mandatory

employees in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the Agency A 5 When a potential training requirement has been identified OHCM will ensure that the training requirement has been properly evaluated in accordance with the SOP The evaluation process will ensure that communications define the training objectives the target audience civil service employees and or contractors deadlines
