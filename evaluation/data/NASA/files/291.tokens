Subject Research Data and Publication Access Responsible Office Office of the Chief Scientist 1 POLICY a This NPD sets forth the basic policy for the implementation of processes to ensure public access to scientific peer reviewed publications see Attachment A for definition and unclassified digital scientific and technical development data sets see Attachment A for definition arising from NASA funded research development and technology RD & T programs unless otherwise restricted by U S statue regulation or Agency policy b NASA maintains strong investments in fundamental and applied research and technology development across a broad range of topics Promoting the full and open sharing of data with the research communities private industry academia and the general public is a longstanding core value of NASA and this policy supports NASA s open access culture to data and publications of all the scientific research that NASA sponsors c It is NASA s policy to 1 Ensure public access to the results of federally funded scientific research 2 Affirm NASA s commitment to public access to information and data arising from technology development programs and projects 3 Ensure access to and reliable preservation of peer reviewed publications that arise from NASA funded research and unclassified digital data sets for research development commercialization educational and related purposes within available resources 4 Preserve and enable increased use of NASA funded scientific research results to enhance scientific discovery and application of research results 5 Promote scientific integrity and support the reproducibility of scientific research results 6 Ensure that all extramural researchers receiving NASA funded grants cooperative agreements and contracts for scientific research and intramural researchers develop an appropriate data management plan describing how they will provide for long term preservation of and access to unclassified scientific data in digital format 7 Optimize for ease of accessibility and use the archiving and dissemination of NASA funded data and publications including long term stewardship 8 Support training education and workforce development related to scientific data management analysis storage preservation and stewardship 9 Support governance of and best practices for managing public access to NASA funded peer reviewed scholarly publications and unclassified digital scientific or research data across NASA 2 APPLICABILITY a This NPD is applicable to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers including Component Facilities Technical and Service Support Centers b This NPD applies to all NASA employees and contractors to the extent provided in their contracts including part time and full time employees c This NPD also applies to NASA grantees conducting scientific research d This language applies to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL a Federally Funded Research and Development Center e This NPD applies to awardees from non NASA organizations and their subcontractors that publish scientific research or compile unclassified digital data sets excluding excepted data resulting from RD & T programs funded through a NASA grant cooperative agreement contract or other agreement f This NPD applies to basic and applied scientific research projects across all NASA organizations implemented after the issuance of this NPD and to both intramural and extramural research projects regardless of funding mechanism grants cooperative agreements contracts space act agreements or internal Agency funding processes g This NPD does not apply to excepted data which are data that will not be made public by definition in Attachment A h In this directive all mandatory actions i e requirements are denoted by statements containing the term shall The terms should denotes a good practice and is recommended but not required will denotes expected outcome and are is denotes descriptive material i Nothing in this NPD is intended to replace or supplant the existing NASA Scientific and Technical Information process including submission of NASA form 1676 3 AUTHORITY a The National Aeronautics and Space Act 51 U S C

Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research c NPD 1000 3 The NASA Organization 4 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS AND FORMS NASA Procedural Requirements NPR 2200 2 Requirements for Documentation Approval and Dissemination of NASA Scientific and Technical Information 5 RESPONSIBILITY a The Office of the Chief Scientist shall Help coordinate the implementation of this policy between NASA funded researchers and the Office of the Chief Information Officer b The Office of the Chief Information Officer shall 1 Establish and manage a team with representation from NASA s research conducting Mission Directorates the Offices of the Chief Scientist the Chief Technologist and the Office of the General Counsel 2 Coordinate the implementation of this NPD with NASA research organizations and the Office of the Administrator 3 Provide the architecture and infrastructure for implementation of this policy with other Federal agencies c Each Mission Directorate Associate Administrator and Center Director shall 1 Develop requirements that incorporate this policy as terms and conditions of NASA funding for grants contracts cooperative agreements directed research projects and other agreements established after issuance of this NPD 2 Comply with this policy within existing budgets and develop long range plans for sustaining this policy 3 Require that their NASA funded researchers intramural and extramural comply with this policy 6 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY The NASA Mission Directorate Associate Administrators and Center Directors may delegate the responsibilities listed in paragraph 5 c to others within their directorates and Center staff as necessary 7 MEASUREMENT VERIFICATION Compliance will be verified by technical program officers through continual evaluation of required project reports 8 CANCELLATION
