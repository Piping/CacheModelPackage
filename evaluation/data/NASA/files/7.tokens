1 12 06 2013 Update to comply with 1400 Compliance with administrative changes update applicable documents delete Attachment A Typical SMA Program Elements and remove requirements numbers 1 POLICY It is NASA policy to a Protect the public NASA workforce high value equipment and property and the environment from potential harm as a result of NASA activities and operations by factoring safety as an integral feature of programs projects technologies operations and facilities b Establish and maintain independent lines of communications for unrestricted flow of information and adjudication of dissenting opinions concerning any matters affecting the ability to meet the safety and mission success requirements and criteria c Hold NASA leaders managers supervisors and employees accountable for safety and mission success within their assigned areas of responsibility d Define and document both safety and mission success requirements and criteria in NASA programs and projects as a foundation for the design and development of safe and reliable program hardware and software e Require all acquisition instruments as specified by the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to appropriately address SMA processes so that the responses to these instruments describe the approach to be used to implement SMA and to manage the associated safety and mission success risk factors f Verify and validate life cycle implementation of the SMA processes and any related safety and mission success requirements through ongoing surveillance of program project and contractor processes g Certify the safety and operational readiness of hazardous or mission critical hardware and software including flight systems support equipment facilities operations ground based systems through a process of formal review of the compilation of validation and verification information h Address safety and mission success concerns requirements noncompliance risks and risk acceptance and appropriate lessons learned at all major management reviews other major milestone review activities and operational readiness reviews i Use qualitative and quantitative risk assessment techniques to develop information for making informed decisions regarding safety and mission success within a structured and formal decision process j Process all technical decisions that result in residual safety and or mission success risk by obtaining 1 The approval concurrence of the cognizant Technical Authority Engineering SMA or Health Medical with the acceptance of risk NOTE The approval or concurrence is based on the technical merit of the case and independent assessment of the risk If the technical decision relates to requirements owned by the Technical Authority then the Technical Authority approves the decision If the technical decision does not relate to requirements owned by the Technical Authority then the Technical Authority concurs with the decision Refer to NPR 7120 5 and to NASA STD 8709 20 Management of Safety and Mission Assurance Technical Authority Requirements for definitions of approval and concurrence 2 Formal approval by the cognizant SMA authority that the risk is acceptable NOTE The cognizant SMA authority should not be confused with Technical Authority SMA authority is the authority assigned by NPD 1000 3 The NASA Organization to the Chief Safety and Mission Assurance to determine if the risk of a hazard exceeds the limits where it can be accepted This authority is not limited solely to hazards related to SMA requirements but to any hazard Application of this authority is intended to be applied at a level consistent with the application of Technical Authority that is to the cognizant SMA authority 3 Formal consent to take any human safety risk by the actual risk taker and an appropriate member of his her supervisory chain NOTE There are two elements to the consent to take risk The first element is that the risk takers themselves volunteer to take the risk The second element is that the appropriate member of the supervisory chain also consents to the risk taking The first element focuses on the willingness of the risk taker to volunteer while the second element provides for a check and balance on the risk taker to alleviate situations where a risk taker might be reluctant to decline taking inappropriate risk 4 Formal acceptance of the risk by the applicable program project or operations and facilities manager NOTE Residual risk is the remaining risk that exists after all mitigation actions have been implemented or exhausted in accordance with the risk management process k Report and track to resolution all corrective actions resulting from investigations of mishaps incidents nonconformances anomalies and safety and mission assurance audits distribute and use lessons learned to improve activities and operations l Encourage support and monitor programs activities and events that strengthen and sustain a healthy safety
