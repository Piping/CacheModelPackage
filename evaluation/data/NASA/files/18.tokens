1 06 17 2013 Update to comply with 1400 Compliance with administrative changes title changes updated Applicable Documents and Forms and added Attachment B for Acronyms 1 POLICY a NASA s goal is to improve the institutional management of the Agency s capital assets b It is NASA s policy to ensure that NASA owned and operated assets are properly aligned with the NASA mission and are safe environmentally sound affordable the right type and size and in good operating condition c NASA s facilities and equipment will be maintained in the most cost effective fashion to minimize risk to processes and products protect the safety and health of personnel and the environment protect and preserve capabilities and capital investments provide quality work places for NASA employees and enable the Agency s mission d NASA will apply the NASA reliability centered maintenance RCM approach which employs a full range of maintenance strategies varying from run to failure to streamlined failure mode and effects analysis FMEA combined with predictive testing and inspection PT & I to institutional and program facilities and related equipment e The Agency policy will be accomplished by 1 Using state of the art management techniques that optimize maintenance activities with respect to risk management and cost RCM practices and appropriate modern PT & I diagnostic techniques will be employed RCM and PT & I will be incorporated into facilities and or equipment program development improvement and implementation to minimize life cycle maintenance and repair costs maintain facilities and equipment at the desired level of reliability and maximize safety These principles are outlined in the NASA Reliability Centered Maintenance for Facilities and Collateral Equipment and the NASA Reliability Centered Building and Equipment Acceptance Guide These guides and other resources are located at http www hq nasa gov office codej codejx under O & M adn Design and Construction respectively 2 Using accepted standards as guidelines to determine facilities and equipment maintenance funding requirements when detailed requirements and associated estimates are not available to serve as a basis for maintenance cost projections 3 Generating tracking trending and managing facilities maintenance activities by using appropriate performance metrics to enable overall maintenance program review and continuous improvement 4 Undertaking benchmarking activities that result in identifying sharing and implementing best practices 5 Ensuring that each Center carries out the Agency policy by a Developing and documenting an appropriate failure analysis for all critical facilities and equipment when failure of the facility facility component or equipment might result in damage to flight hardware which in turn would cause significant disruption in flight research or operations schedules cause severe injury or death or cause significant embarrassment to the Agency Failure analysis will be documented via FMEA fault tree analysis or comparable analysis as appropriate to serve as a basis for risk mitigation planning b Maintaining a list of critical facilities and equipment with accompanying rationale for the designation c Establishing the most cost effective approach regarding Computerized Maintenance Management Systems CMMS to best meet their particular needs and satisfy Integrated Financial and Integrated Asset Management Program requirements Employing automated tools to facilitate maintenance is a benchmark for maintenance excellence d Developing and monitoring performance of an Annual Work Plan AWP that defines and quantifies in terms of budget dollars and or workforce estimates all scheduled maintenance to be accomplished in the following fiscal year and documenting all accomplishments in the current year Annual maintenance and repair plans proposals for institutional and program facilities and related equipment will reflect the level of activity necessary to arrest annual growth of deferred maintenance such as at the level indicated by the Facility Sustainment Model The AWP will address a Preventive maintenance programmed maintenance repair and replacement of obsolete items b Projected operating costs for central utility plants and other services such as grounds care c Allocations for nonscheduled work trouble calls emergency work and nonmaintenance service requests e Accounting for facilities and equipment maintenance and repair expenditures in accordance with the current NASA Financial Management policies NASA contractors that are responsible for facilities maintenance will be required to provide necessary maintenance spending data at individual facility level detail g Assessing facility and equipment conditions by participating in the application of the NASA Deferred Maintenance Parametric Estimating Guide Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and repair visits shall also be used to record condition codes of facilities and equipment for use in the CMMS h Using Performance Based Contracting PBC and best value principles to the maximum extent feasible and practical to shift the appropriate degree of cost risk to contractors and maximize competitive pricing PBC contracts for operations and maintenance of facilities shall be fixed price and or unit priced when the scope of services can be determined The maximum amount of known annual requirements shall be consolidated into the fixed priced core of any PBC 2 APPLICABILITY a This NPD is applicable to NASA Headquarters all NASA Centers Component Facilities other NASA owned facilities all contractors performing facilities maintenance for NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory a Federally Funded Research and Development Center to the extent specified in their contracts b In this directive all mandatory actions i e requirements are denoted by statements containing the term shall The terms may or can denote discretionary privilege or permission should denotes a good practice and is recommended but not required will denotes expected outcome and are is denotes descriptive material c a c In this directive all document citations are assumed to be the latest version unless otherwise noted 3 AUTHORITY a The National Aeronautics and Space Act 51 U S C ยง 20113 a b Standard Numbers 6 8 14 35 and 40 of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board dated May 11 2011 as amended 4 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS a Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act of 2010 Pub L No 111 308 124 Stat 3283 2010 b NPR 8831 2 Facilities Maintenance and Operations Management c NASA Reliability Centered Maintenance Guide for Facilities and Collateral Equipment September 2008 d NASA Reliability Centered Building & Equipment Acceptance Guide July 2004 5 RESPONSIBILITY a The Director Facilities Engineering and Real Property Division as designated by the Assistant Administrator for Strategic Infrastructure shall provide the tools policies and corporate leadership in a participative manner that fosters Agency wide ownership and continuous improvement in facilities maintenance Agency wide ownership means taking a holistic stewardship perspective Primary roles include developing and disseminating policy funding advocacy facilitating broad guidance for adopting best practices and reporting Agency wide status b The NASA Chief Engineer shall provide technical advice and support for evaluation and introduction of new technology analysis and technical management techniques such as RCM for improving the facilities and equipment maintenance process c The NASA Chief Financial Officer or designee shall ensure proper accounting of facilities maintenance repair and operations expenses d The Assistant Administrator for Procurement or designee shall ensure that all contracts containing facilities maintenance work require contractors to provide functional management costs to be used in the NASA accounting system and that fixed priced unit priced performance based contracting is used to the maximum extent feasible and practical for facilities maintenance and operations e The Center Directors shall budget for and provide oversight of facilities maintenance requirements for both institutional and critical program facilities and equipment commensurate with the principles of this directive f The Center Directors shall implement the policies of this directive and are responsible for the overall condition functional usability reliability safety and appearance of all NASA facilities as well as long term stewardship for the future use of all NASA facilities and equipment 1 As such they shall identify and designate a single point of contact to serve as the focal point for all facilities and equipment maintenance issues prepare
