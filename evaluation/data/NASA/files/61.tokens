Subject NASA Exhibits Program w Change 2 Revalidated 03 17 10 Responsible Office Office of Communications CHAPTER 3 Criteria for Evaluation or Requests for NASA Exhibits 3 1 Exhibit Requests 3 1 1 Requests for NASA exhibits shall be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria a The event must be professional trade civic educational or public service in nature This would include national and state educational groups and events such as the Treasury Department s Savings Bonds drives Joint NASA DOD Department of Defense events must define carefully the civilian mission of space exploration Professional and trade meetings must be evaluated to ensure that the requester does not benefit commercially from a NASA presence Local events of short duration and small attendance usually do not justify the expense of providing exhibits staff and other assets and should be declined unless there are extenuating circumstances b Use of NASA exhibits must give no unfair commercial advantage This criterion normally rules out individual businesses and advertising uses but not shopping centers or public relations firms that organize events for public service or educational sponsors See 3 3 below c The requester must be asked to assume all onsite and transportation costs The Public Affairs Office at each NASA Center will exercise good judgment and discretion in evaluating all loan requests and related cost benefits See 3 1 5 and 3 2 1 Short term and long term loans In extenuating circumstances where a loan approval is considered in the best interest of NASA transportation costs usually one way may be borne by NASA at the discretion of the Public Affairs Office at each NASA Center 2 Indefinite term loans Indefinite term loans are encouraged and transportation costs one way or total cost may be borne by NASA at the discretion of the Public Affairs Office at each NASA Center 3 On Site Costs The requester must be asked to pay for all local drayage labor for unpacking erecting dismantling repacking and such other local outlays as site rentals guides janitorial services crate storage electricity telephone or cable internet installation and use insurance and maintenance of the exhibit during the event The requirement for insurance may be waived for nonprofit institutions and in exceptional instances when in the judgment of the NASA Centers Exhibits Managers the requirement is burdensome or the risk is small d There must be no admission fee for the NASA exhibit Although a NASA exhibit may be part of a larger exposition that charges an admission fee such as a state fair the NASA exhibit may never be the major attraction of any such event nor may there be a separate admission for the NASA exhibit See 3 3 below e Exhibits requested for short duration events generally do not justify the expense Such events must be evaluated on the basis of such factors as availability of exhibits nature of event and willingness of sponsor to assume all or most of the costs This criterion also applies to those exhibits not requiring contractor supervisor services 3 2 Showings Initiated by NASA NASA Centers may take the initiative to place their exhibits at selected events when it is deemed necessary or desirable In such cases the criteria in 3 1 3 and 3 1 5 do not apply 3 3 Evaluation Guidelines 3 3 1 The following
