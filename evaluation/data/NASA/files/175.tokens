letters are written in a suggested format However they may be revised if necessary provided there is no substantive change that may invalidate the purpose of the notification If revision is necessary please ensure that the major points are included The purpose of these letters is to convey to the union and to the contractor that NASA intends to establish a reserve gate procedure and that their cooperation is required The language used in the letters should be clear and firm but also invite their cooperation Normally at this juncture both parties are somewhat sensitive so keep this in mind when preparing letters In some instances the reserve gate may be used by all other contractor and NASA personnel This does not change the purpose of the reserve gate which is to restrict the struck contractor s access to the Center through the specific gate s In other cases the NLRB may feel that it is necessary that the reserve gate s be used exclusively by the struck contractor this practice will vary from area to area In cases in which the reserve gate s is to be used exclusively by the struck contractor other contractor civil service personnel must be notified that they cannot use the reserve gate s See sections 4 2 1c and 4 2 1f 3 of this manual D 1 Letter to the Union Note Send copy to Company We are informed that a labor dispute exists between____________________________________
