Subject Policy for NASA Acquisition Responsible Office Office of Strategy and Plans 1 POLICY a This NASA Policy Directive NPD provides the overall policy framework for NASA s strategic acquisition process with appropriate references to other key processes and directives This strategic acquisition process complies with NASA obligations as a Federal agency and is applicable to each of NASA s major areas of investment Flight Programs and Projects Information Technology and Institutional Infrastructure and Research and Technology to ensure the efficient effective use of the resources entrusted to the Agency b NASA s strategic acquisition process supports obtaining or advancing the development of the systems research services construction and supplies to fulfill the Agency s mission and other activities which advance the Agency s statutory objectives Within the framework of this strategic acquisition process NASA utilizes multiple authorities to meet these objectives NASA s authorities include but are not limited to grants cooperative agreements international agreements and Space Act Agreements SAAs in addition to NASA s acquisition authority to contract for goods and services through procurements The Agency also has the authority to enter into other types of arrangements depending on the circumstances such as Inter Agency Agreements IAAs leases concession agreements property loan agreements and Cooperative Research and Development Agreements CRADAs This NPD establishes the strategic acquisition governance framework under which these authorities will be used c This strategic acquisition process supports NASA s strategic management system as defined in NPD 1000 0 Governance and Strategic Management Handbook by augmenting the Agency governance structure for decision making with the processes necessary to support efficient effective execution of Agency programs and projects This strategic acquisition process begins with an idea or proposal that aligns with NPD 1001 0 NASA Strategic Plan and fulfills an identified need or objective and ends with the completion of a program or project or the final disposition of a product or service see Figure 1 0 The integration of the strategic acquisition process and the strategic management system ensures special attention is given to major acquisitions and significant adjustments to portfolio content Major acquisitions that are directed at and critical to fulfilling the Agency s mission entail the allocation of relatively large resources or warrant special management attention d This integration of the strategic acquisition process and the strategic management system is implemented by the Strategy Implementation Planning SIP process that guides specific budget and acquisition decisions This allows the evaluation of issues such as the appropriate application of administration priorities Agency strategic planning and new initiatives in a portfolio of programs and projects and budget availability to assess both short term and long term alignment The SIP process is implemented through select reviews conducted at the direction of the NASA Administrator resulting in guidance to inform the strategic acquisition process This guidance is incorporated into the Strategic Programming Guidance of the Planning Programming Budget and Execution PPBE process and further applied to decisions made in the Agency Acquisition Strategy Meetings ASM conducted by the NASA Associate Administrator See attachment D Figure 1 0 NASA Strategic Acquisition Process e It is NASA policy to 1 Have a strategic acquisition process that complies with a All applicable laws and regulations b Applicable Agency and Center directives requirements procedures and processes c The Agency s core values 2 Execute the strategic acquisition process through a disciplined strategic management system employing a Clearly defined roles responsibilities processes and requirements for planning and execution b Both a short term and long term perspective c Monitoring and or metrics that ensure effective implementation d Appropriate authorizations and approvals that ensure decisions are made in a timely manner Decisions approvals and authorizations are documented in signed agreements A signed agreement between authorized employees of NASA organizations serves as a binding agreement between those organizations A change requires renewed approvals and authorizations or creation of a new agreement e A process that integrates applicable lessons learned and knowledge sharing f Appropriate consideration of all NASA authorities when developing the acquisition strategy 3 Have checks and balances built into the strategic acquisition process that ensure a NASA capabilities as required by senior Agency management to efficiently and effectively implement the NASA Strategic Plan are maintained including workforce and infrastructure over both the short term and long term b Existing NASA capabilities are used rather than acquiring new capabilities when existing capabilities are available and are considered necessary for NASA s strategic future c All major new acquisitions and significant adjustments to portfolio content are reviewed by senior Agency management to ensure they fulfill an identified need that is aligned with the NASA Strategic Plan and are compatible with expected resources and capabilities d The acquisition strategy is reviewed and agreed upon by senior Agency management before authorizing resource expenditures for major acquisitions e Application of Technical Authority Dissenting Opinion independent review safety quality assurance and tailoring principles as defined in NASA policies and procedural requirements are applied and tailored for the selected authority 4 Ensure that personnel involved in the strategic acquisition process have the appropriate skills competencies and certifications across the range of management technical and business disciplines necessary to carry out their individual acquisition responsibilities 5 Ensure that organizations having a substantive interest in the acquisition strategy are effectively integrated into the strategic acquisition process as early as appropriate and throughout the duration of their interest in order to include their needs benefit from their experience and encourage communication 6 Ensure acquisitions that require cost schedule and or confidence level estimates are based on realistic estimates and achievable schedules that a Cover all costs associated with meeting the need or achieving the objective including 1 Costs such as institutional support requirements technology investments and multi Center operations 2 Costs associated with Agency constraints b For major acquisitions are based on probabilistic cost and schedule estimate s and confidence level s that have been approved by the decision authority 7 Ensure when acquisition decisions are made the strategy direction and execution phases have consistent acquisition commitments to assure overall alignment for all authorities using Agency resources with cost estimates by fiscal year and applicable Federal budget account projections 8 Ensure organizations meet programmatic institutional technical cost and schedule commitments to fulfill the NASA acquisition strategy as determined by the selected NASA authority 9 Incorporate a risk informed decision making process that includes the identification analysis and management of programmatic institutional technical cost schedule environmental safety management industry and external policy risks that might jeopardize the successful execution of the Agency s acquisition strategies 10 Consider when developing an acquisition strategy the full spectrum of acquisition approaches as appropriate to advance the Agency s objectives taking into consideration providing best value maximizing competition and preserving the Agency s core capabilities Seek to optimize the use of NASA s industry s and academia s expertise and maintain the required supporting workforce and industrial base 11 Ensure that execution of the acquisition strategy respects and appropriately maintains the relationship between NASA and its suppliers or partners including their separate roles and responsibilities 12 Promote competition and small business participation throughout the strategic acquisition process 13 Require disclosure of financial interests from those persons participating in the strategic acquisition process and avoid personal conflicts of interest to the greatest extent possible in all acquisitions 14 Ensure that organizational conflicts of interest are identified and resolved throughout the strategic acquisition process 2 APPLICABILITY a This
