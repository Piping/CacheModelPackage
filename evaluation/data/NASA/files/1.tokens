challenges including prize competitions and crowdsourcing activities to further the Agency s mission at all levels of the NASA organization The Federal Government has been encouraged to use prizes and challenges as tools to solve problems and drive innovation for specific needs Challenges use afocused problem statement approach to obtain solutions and or stimulate innovation from a broad sometimes undefined public rather than a specific named group or individual Prize competitions and crowdsourcing are two specific techniques for implementing challenges a A challenge implemented as a prize competition is intended to stimulate innovation in a manner that has the potential to advance NASA s mission through the offer of a competitive award b A challenge implemented through crowdsourcing is intended to solicit products services ideas or content contributions from many people often but not necessarily through the Internet and may result in the making of award s c An award can be any form of recognition provided to a participant in a challenge including a cash payment value other than cash e g payment of travel expenses accommodation on a launch vehicle and other forms of reward e g
