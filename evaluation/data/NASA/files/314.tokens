material requirements Material should not be warehoused at a Center unless there is no cost effective alternative 5 Ensure that materials are acquired for immediate use for stock based on past usage history and anticipated need or in the case of program and standby stock for future use to satisfy a known specific project program requirement 6 Ensure that Government owned materials are used only for official purposes Centers shall maintain controls to prevent unauthorized acquisition and use of materials 7 Ensure that assets are subjected to annual and periodic physical inventories in accordance with NASA Procedural Requirements NPR 4100 1 NASA Materials Inventory and Management and that appropriate investigations and adjustments are made to the financial and material records 8 Ensure that material no longer required is promptly identified and processed for disposal in accordance with guidance from NPR 4300 1 9 Maintain auditable document files and records to support transactions against all inventory accounts 10 Ensure that duties and responsibilities for keeping accountable records and for physical custody of inventories and systems thereto be segregated to the

Centers shall be maintained within NASA information systems unless activities related to the inventory are performed by contractors who also are responsible for ordering property for the performance of their contract and the responsible program believes that maintaining the record within the NASA system provides increased and unacceptable risk to the contractor s performance or significant increased cost 1 The contractor shall have an inventory recordkeeping system deemed adequate by NASA Property Administrators 2 The contractor shall provide regular detailed reports of inventory holdings in a format acceptable to the Manager Supply Program Headquarters Logistics Division g All NASA activities utilizing Government accountable supplies shall participate in and comply with the

in all onsite contracts utilizing Government and contractor accountable supplies 2 All items in NASA s supply management systems shall be uniformly identified described classified numbered and published Program and standby stocks unique to each Center may be cataloged locally in accordance with the FCS format but not reported to the FCS h Ensure the use of measures to gauge the effectiveness of supply support and material management process improvement initiatives logistics costs logistics services performance measures metric and self assessments Standardization of measures is to be achieved to the maximum extent possible i Supply support and material management functions shall use NASA s Agency standard data systems Request for waivers should be forwarded to the NASA Headquarters Director for Logistics Management 2 APPLICABILITY a This NPD is applicable to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers including Component Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers These provisions are applicable to any onsite contractor who purchases materials uses Center provided materials inventory management system or who maintains supply systems for NASA only to the entent specified or referenced in the appropriate contracts This policy shall be incorporated in all contracts for onsite NASA material management supply support b When the provisions of this policy conflict with NASA contracts regulated by the Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR Part 45 or NASA FAR Supplement NFS Part 1845 or international agreements and procedures governing materials in foreign countries the provisions of the latter shall govern 3 AUTHORITY a National Aeronautics and Space Act 51 U S C ยง 20113 a 4 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS AND FORMS a Cataloging and Standardization 10 U S C Chapter 145 b
