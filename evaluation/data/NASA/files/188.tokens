Directives Management Team 08 04 2015 Revalidated for another 5 years with administrative edits made to Figure 1 in Attachment D to make clear that interim directives are on the same level as other directive types to remove unnecessary shall statements in the responsibility and measurements sections and to add an additional authority requiring directives management 1 POLICY a It is NASA s policy to establish document and promulgate internal NASA requirements in order to communicate these requirements in a clear efficient and concise manner and where necessary to fulfill the Agency s vision mission and external mandates 1 An internal NASA requirement is a statement of mandatory instructions imposed by NASA that a NASA employee or organization will perform or a statement of form and or function that a piece of equipment or system will meet 2 An internal NASA requirements document is any document used to record and communicate the internal requirements and responsibilities necessary to fulfill the Agency s vision mission and external mandates b NASA s policy is to also establish charters to govern councils boards committees panels or working groups mandated by statute the NASA Administrator or Officials in Charge of Headquarters Offices in order to make decisions for the Agency c It is NASA s policy that all internal NASA requirements documents are 1 Developed and controlled by a documented process 2 Clearly labeled as containing requirements 3 Available Agency wide to those who need them 4 Verifiable for internal external audits 5 Current 6 Traceable to governing documents d It is NASA s policy to review all Agency level directives for cost benefit impacts as described in NPR 1400 1 NASA Directives and Charters Procedural Requirements e It is NASA s policy that all internal NASA charters comply with the provisions of paragraphs 1a and 1c excluding paragraphs 1c 2 and 4 f When internal requirements are consistent with the purpose of an external requirement but meet or exceed those requirements thereby making internal requirements more stringent it is NASA policy that the internal NASA requirements apply See Attachment C for examples of external requirements g It is NASA s policy that NASA directives take precedence over all other internal NASA requirements The flow and order of precedence for internal NASA documents are described in Figure 1 of Attachment D Attachment A provides the definition for the documents that constitute NASA directives h It is NASA s policy that internal NASA documents other than directives such as the examples mentioned in Attachment C become requirements when a directive specifies its use by citing the document s title revision letter number and date or when a NASA manager with authority over a NASA program project or other activity identifies it as a requirement 2 APPLICABILITY a This NPD is applicable to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers including Component Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers b This NPD is applicable to internal NASA requirements and charters developed or revised after the effective date of this NPD c In this NPD all mandatory actions i e

NASA programs 6 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY 7 MEASUREMENT VERIFICATION a The Mission Support Directorate will measure compliance with this directive by 1 Monitoring assessments audits and surveillance results from Officials in Charge of Headquarters Offices and NASA Center Directors 2 Monitoring whether issuance cancellation and revision of internal NASA requirements are being effectively disseminated b Officials in Charge of Headquarters Offices and Center Directors will monitor at an interval based on the level of risk to the Agency if their organization s internal NASA requirements described in Attachment C comply with the requirements in paragraph 1c by 1 Ensuring that internal requirements are traceable to official policy or external authority 2 Demonstrating that internal requirements are developed and controlled by a documented process as evidenced by an approved written procedure on that process 3 Demonstrating that internal requirement documents are clearly labeled as containing requirements 4 Demonstrating that internal requirements are accessible to the people who use them as evidenced by having them Web accessible folder accessible or accessible by other means suitable to the intended audience 5 Demonstrating that internal requirements are verifiable as evidenced by a stated or obvious method of proving compliance 6 Demonstrating that internal requirements are current as evidenced by having an expiration date that has not passed and having a documented account of periodic reviews to determine if content is up to date 8 CANCELLATION NPD 1400 1J Documentation and Promulgation of Internal NASA Requirements dated March 3 2005 s Charles F Bolden Jr Administrator ATTACHMENT A Definitions Agency level directives are directives e g NASA Policy Directives NPD NASA Procedural Requirements NPR and NASA Interim Directives NID with Agency wide applicability NPDs are policy statements that describe what is required by NASA management to achieve NASA s vision mission and external mandates and who is responsible for carrying out those requirements An NPD may be referenced in one or more NPR Center level directives or other internal requirements NPDs apply to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers including Component Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers The signatory authority for NPDs is the NASA Administrator NPRs provide the Agency s mandatory instructions and requirements to implement NASA policy as delineated in an associated NPD All NPRs relate to one of more NPDs NPRs apply to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers including Component Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers The signatory authority for NPRs is the Official in Charge OIC of the Headquarters Office originating the NPR See NPD

specifies its use by citing the document s title revision letter number and date or when a NASA manager with authority over a NASA program project or other activity identifies it as a requirement The following are examples of other NASA internal documents a NASA Technical Standards NASA technical standards are NASA documents that contain common and repeated use of rules conditions guidelines or characteristics for products or related processes and production methods and related management systems practices NASA technical standards may contain the definition of terms classification of components delineation of procedures specification of dimensions materials performance designs or operations measurement of quality and quantity in describing materials processes products systems services or practices test methods and sampling procedures or descriptions of fit and measurements of size or strength Within NASA the broad term standard may include the following specific document types codes guidebooks handbooks specifications and standards with NASA Technical Standards Products NASA technical standards products are NASA documents that contain common and repeated use of rules conditions guidelines or characteristics for products or related processes and production methods and related management systems practices NASA technical standards products may contain the definition

NASA may adopt standards developed outside NASA in lieu of developing a NASA directive or standard These include standards developed by other United States Government agencies or other standards development organizations See OPM Circular A 119 and NPR 7120 10 b Plans Plans are NASA documents that present goals objectives and operational details to guide users in achieving NASA s mission NASA s planning process starts with long term vision and mission and flows to more focused near term plans and documents Appendix IV of NPD 1001 0 NASA Strategic Plan describes the relationship among strategic and planning documents c Manuals Manuals are NASA documents that explain functions outline procedures or provide additional details for an operation Manuals usually contain examples to help users perform specific tasks d Internal Agreements Internal Agreements in the context of this NPD are NASA documented commitments between NASA organizations or between a NASA individual and another NASA party e Work Instructions Work instructions are NASA documents that contain instructional requirements applied to an individual organization They define the processes used to deliver products to customers or to meet the organization s mission requirements as defined by directives f Guidance A statement of expectation that does not mandate compliance ATTACHMENT D Flow and Order of Precedence
