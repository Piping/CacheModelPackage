Updated with 1400 compliance change office titles and clarify office responsibilities 1 POLICY a It is NASA policy that reimbursable use of NASA facilities by or for the benefit of foreign entities or conducting of research on a reimbursable basis in collaboration with or for the benefit of foreign entitites comply with U S standards and safeguards This NASA Policy Directive NPD provides general policy direction and identifies principles to be considered by NASA officials b This NPD supplements and clarifies existing requirements found in relevant NPDs and NASA Procedural Requirements NPRs c Several provisions of law and policy authorize and direct NASA to cooperate and collaborate with foreign entities including the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 Space Act the U S National Aeronautics Research and Development Policy of December 20 2006 the U S National Space Policy of August 31 2006 and the U S Space Exploration Policy of January 14 2004 Such cooperation and collaboration are subject to important standards and safeguards reflecting the significant investment made by the Congress and people of the United States in NASA s world class facilities and expertise Accordingly the principles described in this NPD will govern the evaluation of potential reimbursable use by or for the benefit of foreign entities of NASA facilities and research capabilities d Coordination with NASA Headquarters In all cases use of NASA facilities or services by or for the benefit of foreign entities shall be coordinated with and receive the concurrence of the NASA Headquarters International and Interagency Relations OIIR and the relevant NASA Headquarters Mission Directorate s The OIIR has the authority to execute agreements with foreign entities required for reimbursable activities Additionally the OIIR willl consult with the Office of Public Affairs and the Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs and other appropriate offices prior to final approval e Consistency with NASA s Mission The use of NASA facilities or capabilities shall be consistent with the Agency s mission as described in the Space Act Therefore any proposed foreign reimbursable use of NASA s facilities or resources whether commercial academic governmental or otherwise will demonstrate that it is consistent with NASA s mission Coordination of proposed reimbursable activities with the relevant NASA Mission Directorate s as required in paragraph d above and in section 5 of this NPD will ensure that such activities are properly aligned with NASA s mission f Additionally reimbursable uses will fulfill one or more of the following conditions 1 Sustain or enhance facilities and lower operational costs for current and future needs of NASA s missions in compliance with NASA facilities management policies 2 Sustain or enhance skills that are or are projected to be needed to support NASA s missions 3 Sustain or enhance a functional area not adequately funded by NASA programs but required for current or future support of NASA s missions g Scientific Technical Economic or Foreign Policy Benefit to NASA and the United States All reimbursable arrangements shall advance one or more of NASA s objectives as described in the Space Act For example the goal of advancing NASA s objectives may be met by ensuring access to test results enabling technology transfer to NASA or to the public sector enhancing cross fertilization of knowledge providing technical assistance to allies contributing to a mission or to operational infrastructure systems providing unique services enhancing NASA workforce skills and capabilities sharing of data rights or publication of results and sharing of intellectual property rights or patent licensing arrangements These or other contributions may provide benefits to NASA or to the general public that justify foreign reimbursable use of NASA resources Additionally in certain circumstances reimbursable collaboration with a foreign entity may directly support broader U S policy or interests including important foreign policy objectives h Data and Publication Rights The data rights clauses included in Space Act Agreements for reimbursable test or research activities provide a useful gauge to assess the appropriateness and desirability of proposed reimbursable uses of NASA s facilities and capabilities by or for the benefit of foreign entities As described above reimbursable arrangements which include shared data rights or which authorize broad dissemination of the results of fundamental research related to NASA s missions provide a benefit that is consistent with NASA s Space Act mandate to provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results thereof 42 U S C ºº 2473 a 3 Where the data from such activities is made available to the broad scientific community or the public at large the proposed use normally will be approved subject to the activity s consistency with the other policy standards described in this NPD Conversely an agreement to grant a foreign entity exclusive rights to test or research results minimizes the scientific benefit to NASA and the public and will be carefully evaluated and approved only on a case by case basis consistent with the other principles enumerated in this NPD i Noninterference with NASA Priorities Reimbursable use of NASA facilities and services by or for the benefit of foreign entities shall not interfere with NASA mission requirements or program or project activities By its nature reimbursable work would not otherwise be undertaken if NASA s facilities and capabilities were fully engaged in the execution of national programs or international cooperative activities Therefore any reimbursable work will be secondary to NASA s nonreimbursable priorities and NASA may reschedule postpone or terminate reimbursable work in accordance with Agency policy and the terms of the agreement under which the reimbursable work is to be performed NASA willl seek to minimize the impact of prioritization on reimbursable work as appropriate in particular circumstances j Noncompetition with the Private Sector NASA shall not compete with the private sector Both Federal statute and policy make this clear and issues related to U S industrial competitiveness will be considered in accommodating reimbursable projects with foreign entities The U S National Space Policy of August 31 2006 and the U S National Aeronautics Research and Development Policy of December 20 2006 direct the Federal Government to use commercial capabilities and services to the maximum practical extent and to refrain from conducting activities that preclude deter or compete with U S commercial aeronautics space and other activities unless required for national security or public safety However where equivalent commercial services are not available on reasonable terms the Commercial Space Competitiveness Act 15 U S C º 5807 permits the Federal Government to allow non Federal entities to use Federal space related facilities on a reimbursable basis k Protection Against Unwarranted International Technology Transfer and Consistency with U S Nonproliferation and Export Control Laws Regulations and Policies Foreign use of NASA research capabilities or facilities shall be consistent with the nonproliferation and export control laws regulations and policies of the United States and arrangements for such collaborative projects shall take into consideration the need to protect against inappropriate transfers of technology While NASA technology is generally furnished to foreign entities in order to fulfill NASA responsibilities in cooperative international agreements the furnishing of technology to foreign entities under reimbursable arrangements will be subject to a higher level of scrutiny Improving the technical capabilities of U S adversaries and enhancing the performance of foreign competitors of the U S industrial base are not consistent with NASA s mission Indeed as a U S Government agency on the forefront of technological development in the fields of space aeronautics and science NASA is obliged and committed to be a responsible steward of the technologies and capabilities entrusted to it by the Congress and the people of the United States Accordingly review by NASA Export Control Administrators is required for any proposal involving the reimbursable use of NASA facilities or capabilities by or for the benefit of foreign entities This is particularly true in the case of advanced research and development activities in contrast to fundamental research or basic testing programs or projects l Conformance with Safety and Security Requirements As described in NPD 8700 1 NASA Policy for Safety and Mission Success it is well established NASA policy to protect the public the NASA workforce the environment and high value equipment and property from potential harm as a result of NASA activities and operations by providing safe programs technologies operations and facilities NASA officials are responsible for the safety and mission success of their activities and must maintain the safe and successful functioning of facilities Additionally consistent with NPR 1600 1 NASA Security Program Procedural Requirements and with NPR 2810 1 Security of Information Technology NASA shall ensure the protection of people property and information whenever granting access to NASA facilities or capabilities including access to NASA s Information Technology IT systems Therefore agreements governing foreign reimbursable use of the Agency s resources will comply with NASA security IT security and safety policies and guidelines including standards on facility operations badging credentials and facility and IT system access m Foreign Reimbursable Use of Wind Tunnels Consistent with the requirements of 14 CFR º 1210 proposals for the use of NASA wind tunnels by or for foreign entities including use of wind tunnels by U S companies with foreign participation e g consortium projects shall disclose the foreign interest in or anticipated foreign benefit from the tests to be conducted and will be reviewed by the OIIR in consultation with the relevant Mission Directorate for consistency with U S foreign policy and compatibility with section 102 of the Space Act The other standards and principles identified in this NPD will also be included in such review Because the relevant regulations discourage the use of NASA wind tunnels for the sole benefit of foreign company projects that are unrelated to U S Government or U S industry programs or projects requests for such reimbursable use will additionally identify any compelling basis for approval n Consistency with NASA Financial Management Policy for Determining Allocating and Billing Costs All reimbursable activities subject to this NPD shall comply with NASA Financial Management Requirements Volume 16 Reimbursable Agreements Under NASA policies for reimbursable agreements the customer is generally charged the full cost or market price which is reviewed annually to ensure that it is appropriate for the activity However if NASA is obtaining rights to intellectual property or data or some other benefit the additional benefit may justify NASA s acceptance of reimbursement for less than the full cost or market price of its activities performed under the agreement In such cases the approving NASA official is responsible for determining that the partner s contribution is fair and reasonable and provides an adequate quid pro quo i e equitable exchange when compared to NASA s contribution the NASA resources to be committed NASA program risks and corresponding benefits to NASA In general equivalent financial terms will be provided to U S commercial and foreign entities for reimbursable use of NASA facilities or resources Note For use of NASA wind tunnels by U S foreign consortia 14 CFR 1210 c provides that a fee will be charged for these consortium projects unless in these review procedures it is determined that Government agency cooperative sponsorship warrants a non fee arrangement o Requirement for Agreement Each foreign reimbursable project shall be established in a formal written and signed project or program agreement coordinated through concurred in and executed by the OIIR or delegated office which specifically states the responsibilities of each partner Specific authorities and requirements regarding agreements are provided in NPD 1050 1 Authority to Enter Into Space Act Agreements General agreements that establish intent to explore and facilitate collaboration may be useful or necessary under exceptional circumstances however commitment by the Agency to collaborate in a specific research or test project is only made in a project specific agreement after full coordination and approval of the proposed activity To minimize complexity the division of responsibilities between NASA and the foreign partner will be clearly defined 2
