Subject Authority to Enter into Cooperative Research and Development Agreements Responsible Office Office of the General Counsel NAII 1050 2 Cooperative Research and Development Agreement CRADA Program Information Package PDF Version 1 POLICY a It is NASA s policy to use Cooperative Research and Development Agreements CRADAs as appropriate to transfer federally owned or originated technology to non Federal entities and improve access to science and technology consistent with the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 FTTA which amends the Stevenson Wydler Act of 1980 CRADAs must comply with the FTTA as well as Executive policy including Executive Order 12591 dated April 10 1987 Facilitating Access to Science and Technology as amended by Executive Order 12618 dated December 22 1987 Uniform Treatment of Federally Funded Inventions Presidential Memorandum dated October 28 2011 Accelerating Technology Transfer and Commercialization of Federal Research in Support of High Growth Businesses and Presidential Memorandum dated February 18 1983 Memorandum on Government Patent Policy The goals of the FTTA and Executive policy are to ensure the full use of the results of the Nation s Federal investment in research and development and broaden the U S technology base by moving new knowledge into the development of new products and processes outside the U S Government b This NASA Policy Document NPD provides authority for Center Directors to negotiate execute amend and terminate domestic CRADAs when the activity does not benefit a foreign entity within their areas of jurisdiction It does not address policies for CRADAs executed under authority remaining with the Administrator Authority to enter into CRADAs with or for the benefit of foreign non U S entities is not delegated to Center Directors and remains with the Administrator c The FTTA and Executive policy authorize NASA as a Federal laboratory to enter into CRADAs for research and development consistent with NASA s mission Use of a CRADA should be considered when the primary purpose of the activity is to ensure the full use of the results of NASA s investment in research and development outside the U S Government NASA CRADAs advance the purpose of the FTTA by providing a Collaborating Party access to NASA goods services and facilities in a manner that is consistent with NASA mission requirements to support the transfer of NASA technology and commercial technology development d Use of CRADAs is not mandatory Centers may choose to support the goals of the FTTA through the use of a Space Act Agreement rather than a CRADA The decision to use a CRADA or a Space Act Agreement will be determined by the Office of Chief Counsel in consultation with the NASA designee supporting the activity as to which approach most appropriately supports the goals of the proposed activity Activities with or for the benefit of foreign entities will normally be conducted through Space Act Agreements e CRADAs are treated as fully reimbursable agreements for the purpose of NASA Office of Chief Financial Officer CFO policy Centers may waive costs under CRADAs consistent with NASA policy on reimbursable agreements including the requirements for Center or Agency CFO review Waivers of costs under CRADAs should only be considered where there is a clear and demonstrated NASA benefit To the extent practicable the benefit should be quantifiable so that its value can be reasonably estimated and compared with the amount of reimbursement to be waived Centers may not provide funding to a non Federal Collaborating Party Appropriated funding may be provided to another Federal agency to support CRADA activities only in compliance with applicable law and policy f CRADAs shall comply with the following requirements 1 All CRADAs entered into pursuant to this NPD shall be done in accordance with the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement NASA Advisory Implementing Instruction NAII 1050 2 CRADA Program Information Package or PIP including compliance with the preliminary abstract review process 2 CRADAs shall include provisions specifying the following a Respective responsibilities of NASA and the Collaborating Party with the standard of performance based on reasonable efforts that are stated with sufficient clarity to support preparation of Estimated Price Reports sound management planning and efficient CRADA administration CRADAs may involve other Federal agencies however each CRADA must include at least one non Federal Collaborating Party b Performance milestones c Clearly defined financial commitments including a statement that NASA s performance of the CRADA is subject to the availability of appropriated funds and that no provision of the CRADA shall be interpreted to require obligation or payment of funds in violation of the FTTA 15 U S C § 3710a b 3 A or the Anti Deficiency Act 31 U S C § 1341 d Resource commitments providing that NASA s use of its goods services and facilities shall have priority over the usage planned in the CRADA e Allocation of liability between NASA and the Collaborating Party f Allocation of intellectual property rights implicated by or created under the CRADA consistent with the FTTA including providing the Collaborating Party the option for an exclusive license for a pre negotiated field of use for any invention made in whole or in part by a NASA employee under the CRADA or any pre existing federally owned invention directly within the scope of the CRADA for which NASA shall retain a government purpose license g Termination rights and obligations h A fixed expiration date as specified in the CRADA PIP 3 Small Business NASA shall give special consideration to small
