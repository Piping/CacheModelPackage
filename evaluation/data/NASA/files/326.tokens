Subject Curation of Institutional Scientific Collections Responsible Office Office of the Chief Scientist 1 POLICY a It is NASA s policy to provide for the curation of NASA s institutional scientific collections as a set of physical specimens living or inanimate created for the purpose of supporting science and serving as a long term research asset and as appropriate and feasible the associated specimen data and materials The materials in NASA s scientific collections represent a unique and limited national resource and an important legacy to future generations Such scientific collections at NASA may include but are not limited to 1 extraterrestrial materials 2 space exposed hardware deemed critical for curation for research by the appropriate authority 3 biological and human research samples 4 physical materials derived from space flight programs and 5 other such collections that have been established prior to during or subsequent to the effective date of this policy b This NPD also sets policy for the programmatic management control and operations of these institutional scientific collections as well as for the planning for curation of new collections This NPD does not establish policy for NASA s project scientific samples which are samples unique to projects and not publicly accessible or artifacts For project scientific collections that are likely to become in whole or in part institutional scientific collections in the future this NPD should be treated a guide to best practices and followed to the greatest extent possible 2 APPLICABILITY a This NPD is applicable to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers including Component Facilities Technical and Service Support Centers and to all non NASA facilities that manage NASA owned institutional scientific collections b This NPD applies to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL a Federally Funded Research and Development Center c This NPD applies to contracts cooperative agreements and or other NASA supported agreements which do may generate what are or will become NASA owned institutional scientific collections and may apply to grants d In this directive all mandatory actions i e requirements are denoted by statements containing the term shall The terms should denotes a good practice and is recommended but not required will denotes expected outcome and are is denotes descriptive material 3 AUTHORITY a The National Aeronautics and Space Act 51 U S C 20113 a as amended b NPD 1000 3 The NASA Organization 4 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS AND FORMS Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Improving the Management of and Access to Scientific Collections Office of the White House March 2014 5 RESPONSIBILITY Each institutional scientific collection and or planned collection or a group of related institutional scientific collections will be curated according to its respective NASA Policy Requirements NPR document in its responsible NASA Center with the respective NASA Directorate being responsible for implementation of this policy In each case the authority and responsibilities shall be as follows 1 The Office of the Chief Scientist or designee has the authority for the following a Declaring that a new or existing collection falls under this directive and identifying the Mission Directorate responsible for curation which may be different from the Mission Directorate that acquired the specimens in the collection b Concurring with deaccessioning and or transfer of collections outside of NASA under recommendation by the NASA Directorates c Ensuring that NASA Procedural Requirements documents NPRs for planned and new collections are written or modified when such institutional collections are identified 2 The Associate Administrator or designee of the relevant Mission Directorate the Mission Directorate responsible for curation shall be responsible for the following a Preparation of budgets development of requirements long range plans and maintenance of appropriate balance between elements of the program The budget specific to curation shall be an identified part of the Directorate s overall budget An estimate of costs associated with implementation of this policy will be determined based on the number of institutional scientific collections identified and the management requirements of each by subject matter experts The costs will be entered into the NASA PPBE budget planning process b Interaction with other NASA offices or the exercise of other responsibilities as may be necessary to maintain and protect the curated material c Development and approval of a review and allocation process for the distribution of institutional scientific collection materials to qualified proposers and to meet other NASA programmatic requirements except as described below d Development and approval of curation requirements and policies consistent with this NPD for all institutional scientific collections or groups of institutional scientific collections for which the directorate is responsible e Deciding which NASA center shall be responsible for implementing the curation of the collection f Approving the accessioning deaccessioning and transferring of institutional scientific collection materials g Updating requirements documents when a new institutional scientific collection is identified and maintaining the relevant NASA Procedural Requirements documents h Providing annual reports to the Office of the Chief Scientist on the status of collections 3 The Center Director of the NASA center that houses the institutional scientific collection s shall be responsible for the long term curation and management of each institutional scientific collection which includes the following a Documentation accessioning preparation inventory monitoring labeling and deaccessioning of samples b The physical security including suitable storage and curation facilities protection preservation and proper environment of samples c The development and maintenance of the system of detailed procedures through which the distribution of curated materials are controlled and the implementation of that system in conjunction with other NASA offices as necessary d Online publication of information about institutional collections and the samples contained within them without restriction except as required to maintain security privacy comply with federal law and or to address other matters of national interest e Making samples in institutional scientific collections and associated data accessible to qualified proposers within and outside of the Agency subject to privacy security and export control restrictions procedures for requesting access to samples and information about how such requests will be evaluated shall be posted online publicly f Identifying to the fullest extent that is practicable representative portions of all curated specimens to be preserved for future generations of researchers g The periodic review not less than every 5 years of project scientific collections for consideration as institutional scientific collections to maximize availability of NASA s samples to qualified proposers 6 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY The NASA Mission Directorate Associate Administrators and Center Directors may delegate the responsibilities listed in section 5 to others within their directorates and center staff as necessary 7 MEASUREMENT VERIFICATION The Office of the Chief Scientist will collect annual reports from the responsible directorates according to the responsibilities listed in this NPR are being executed 8 CANCELLATION NPD 7100 10E Curation of Extraterrestrial Materials dated February 11
