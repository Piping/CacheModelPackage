Subject NASA Materials Inventory Management Manual Revalidated 2 9 06 Responsible Office Logistics Management Division Chapter 5 Physical Inventory of Materials 5 1 Requirement for Physical Inventories Physical inventories of Center materials inventory shall be taken to determine the accuracy of the records and the adequacy of the control system 5 2 Inventory Methods 5 2 1 All inventories under perpetual control shall be inventoried annually using a sampling procedure However once every 5 years a complete wall to wall inventory shall be conducted instead of the sample This requirement may be fulfilled on a cyclical basis Centers may schedule the wall to wall inventory incrementally by status code type account code storage facility or any other method that ensures that every item is inventoried at least once every 5 years 5 2 2 Centers shall perform a wall to wall physical inventory of all onsite stock locations whether Stores Stock or Program Stock when the contract for operation of that stock location expires The purpose of this physical inventory is to ensure a reasonable level of accuracy of item records for the continuing requirement to maintain effective and efficient supply support The SEMO may waive this requirement if the latest wall to wall inventory or latest wall to wall increment has a less than 20 percent error rate of line items and gross adjustment value When a waiver is granted the result of the last physical inventory shall be disclosed to the new contractor 5 2 3 Materials acquired and stocked by contractor personnel onsite at NASA Centers whether for Government or contractor use or both remain accountable to the Government The contract provides for this through the NASA FAR Supplement clause 1852 245 71 entitled Center Accountable Government Property and expressly requires the contractor to manage the materials in accordance with this manual When physical inventories indicate that 90 percent record accuracy is not being maintained the consequences specified by paragraph 5 5 are invoked 5 2 4 This manual does not govern management of materials that are contractor accountable under the Federal Acquisition Regulation either onsite at a NASA Center or offsite at a contractor location Management of such materials is in accordance with the contractor s own Government approved property management system under the requirements of the FAR The SEMO does not have authority to waive the physical inventory required by the FAR at the completion of such contracts 5 3 General Inventory Procedures 5 3 1 All of the items on record shall be included as part of the sample pool or shall be counted during a complete inventory To ensure that all locations are identified and all items in the warehouse are properly recorded prior to the inventory a location validation shall be made prior to full lot and wall to wall inventories A location is not required to be validated for sample inventories and in any event not more than once a year 5 3 2 Each count of a materials inventory line item shall be taken using a new count card or listing The individual counting and the individual verifying if a verifier is used shall sign or initial and date the count card or listing after entering the quantity counted The record balance shall not be entered on a count card or listing prior to the count When a verifier is used a recount is not necessary If however the SEMO deems that a recount is needed it shall be taken by an individual other than the original counter or verifier To maintain a system of checks and balances individuals such as warehouse and storage personnel shall not be allowed to inventory materials under their custodial care and responsibility If such a situation cannot be avoided then the inventory count must be spot checked through random sample by an individual who does not have direct custodial responsibility 5 3 3 The physical inventory control record shall clearly indicate the record quantity each count quantity whether or not the count quantity constituted an error or variance and the resolution of differing counts 5 4 Sampling Procedures 5 4 1 The sampling procedures outlined in this paragraph are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the inventory control system is adequate In percentage terms it provides approximately 95 percent confidence that 85 percent of the records are within the acceptable error limits 5 4 2 Inventories under perpetual control shall be examined using a lot sampling technique When a lot fails to pass the sample it shall be completely counted and the records adjusted accordingly Inventories shall be taken annually either all at once or on a scheduled cyclic basis throughout a fiscal year If in the judgment of the SEMO there is a high probability that the sample inventory shall be unacceptable a complete lot or wall to wall inventory may be taken without first taking a sample 5 4 3 Lots shall be reasonably uniform in size and shall be limited to one status code of inventory unless the inventory records for all status codes are identically maintained Each lot may comprise one or more types of accounts from 1201 1215 Type accounts may be split to provide uniform lot sizes 5 4 4 Sample size and error limits for varying size lots areas follow SAMPLE SIZES AND ERROR LIMITS Lot Size
