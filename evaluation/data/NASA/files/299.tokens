Responsible Office Office of the Chief Information Officer 1 POLICY a This directive establishes the policy and responsibilities for maintaining and using the NASA Enterprise Architecture EA Under the direction of the Agency Chief Information Officer CIO NASA will establish an EA Program NASA EA Program to develop and maintain the NASA EA that will serve as the primary authoritative resource for Information Technology IT planning and execution b The NASA EA shall 1 be a composition of architectures and set of integrated reference models that map all IT initiatives capabilities and services to Agency needs 2 serve to guide executive decision making establishing a clear linkage between present capabilities and future NASA mission needs This includes the identification of potential shortfalls and redundancies in IT capabilities the timeframe in which the shortfall or redundancy exists and an analysis of the industry alternatives and remedial solutions approaches 3 provide a foundation for further development modernization or modification and enhancements of integrated architectures 4 identify mission IT dependencies 5 make service and related information available through the NASA Open Government initiative 6 be used as a tool to integrate strategic planning efforts and to select guide manage rationalize and prioritize Agency investments 7 establish the framework for Agency interoperability by providing the standard rigorous construct for horizontal and vertical integration of mission needs and business processes through architecture 8 be integral to the budget life cycle enabling informed and timely procurement decision making to influence capital and strategic sourcing investments and 9 promote transparency and accountability by aligning NASA functions capabilities services systems components and related standards to Agency strategy Agency strategy may also be informed by a better understanding of all these mission support elements c The NASA EA Program shall define the NASA EA the operational parameters for its development and requirements for its intended use d The NASA EA common framework and methodology shall be used Agency wide 2

management tool 2 be responsible for the implementation and management of the EA Program and as such provides its strategic direction and enforces its requirements 3 appoint a NASA Chief Enterprise Architect NCEA with the day to day responsibility for managing the NASA EA Program conducting oversight of its implementation throughout the Agency and measuring the use of EA as the organizing construct for enabling a highly integrated mission and institution and 4 develop policy and procedure for integrated capabilities based planning to augment and facilitate existing strategic planning processes b Each Directorate Associate Administrator shall be responsible for ensuring that their respective current and future directorate requirements needs activities and capabilities are appropriately integrated into the NASA EA and use their discretion in assigning appropriate personnel to this activity c The Assistant Administrator for Procurement shall 1 be responsible for the inclusion of appropriate contract clauses that contain the requirement for compliance and alignment with the NASA EA and 2 shall use EA artifacts as a contributing component of the Agency wide procurement strategy d The Chief Financial Officer CFO shall 1 use the NASA EA as the basis for Agency IT financial management planning including those required in the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 the CFO Act as amended and 2 collaborate with the CIO to ensure that the NASA EA supports the Agency s Planning Programming and Budget Execution PPBE processes e The Agency Chief Engineer CE shall work with the NCEA to assist in the creation maintenance and governance of an EA that establishes 1 a strategic direction for the Agency s IT services in support of the CE s mission objectives 2 a long term plan for implementing those services according to the CE s needs 3 a basis for assessing program and project compliance with the strategy and plan 4 a basis for measuring the performance of existing and future IT services and 5 reference for iteratively integrating and optimizing the Agency s ability to achieve its strategic goals f The NCEA shall 1 develop and maintaining the NASA EA 2 issue procedures technical standards and guidelines associated with the EA 3 report through the Office of the Chief Information Officer on the maturity of the EA Program to the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office 4 use the EA to plan design and manage services investments through technology forecasts such that institutional provisioning of IT capabilities anticipates and services programmatic needs 5 coordinate with stakeholders to ensure their requirements are captured in the NASA EA and make the contents of the NASA EA widely available and 6 issue guiding principles procedures and technical standards for the EA to create an integrated Agency wide perspective including a function as integrator for the Agency EA facilitating the coordination and collaboration between architecture elements g Each Center Director including the JPL an FFRDC Director shall 1 be responsible for governing Center level IT investment implementation and operation decisions and activities based on the NASA EA 2 collaborate across Center level organizations programs and projects to progressively integrate IT needs and architecture activities into the NASA EA and 3 appoint a responsible designee Center Enterprise Architect for Center level architecture activities h Each Center Enterprise Architect shall 1 be responsible for interface collaboration and coordination of EA activities with the NCEA and the Mission Directorate programs and projects at their Center and 2 interface as required to maintain alignment with the NASA EA including adhering to standards and other guidance as appropriate from the NCEA 6 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY None 7 MEASUREMENTS NASA Headquarters Mission Directorates NASA Centers Component Facilities and JPL an FFRDC shall
