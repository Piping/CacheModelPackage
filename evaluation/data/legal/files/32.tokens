House amendment to adopt an idea contained in sections 301 and 303 of the Senate amendment requiring a petition commencing a case to be filed with the bankruptcy court The exception contained in section 301 of the Senate bill relating to cases filed under chapter 9 is deleted Chapter 9 cases will be handled by a bankruptcy court as are other title 11 cases senate report no 95 – 989 Section 301 specifies the manner in which a voluntary bankruptcy case is commenced The debtor files a petition under this section under the particular operative chapter of the bankruptcy code under which he wishes to proceed The filing of the petition constitutes an order for relief in the case under that chapter The section contains no change from current law except for the use of the phrase order for relief instead of adjudication The term adjudication is replaced by a less pejorative phrase in light of the clear power of Congress to permit voluntary bankruptcy without the necessity for an adjudication as under the 1898 act [ former title 11 ] which was adopted when voluntary bankruptcy was a concept not thoroughly tested Amendments 2005 — Pub L 109 – 8 designated existing provisions as

1501 of Pub L 109 – 8 set out as a note under section 101 of this title § 302 Joint cases a A joint case under a chapter of this title is commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court of a single petition under such chapter by an individual that may be a debtor under such chapter and such individual s spouse The commencement of a joint case under a chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief under such chapter b After the commencement of a joint case the court shall determine the extent if any to which the debtors estates shall be consolidated Pub L 95 – 598 Nov 6 1978 92 Stat 2558 Historical and Revision Notes senate report no 95 – 989 A joint case is a voluntary bankruptcy case concerning a wife and husband Under current law there is no explicit provision for joint cases Very often however in the consumer debtor context a husband and wife are jointly liable on their debts and jointly hold most of their property A joint case will facilitate consolidation of their estates to the benefit of both the debtors and their creditors because the cost of administration will be reduced and there will be only one filing fee Section 302 specifies that a joint case is commenced by the filing of a petition under an appropriate chapter by an individual and that individual s spouse Thus one spouse cannot take the other into bankruptcy without the other s knowledge or consent The filing of the petition constitutes an order for relief under the chapter selected Subsection b requires the court to determine the extent if any to which the estates of the two debtors will be consolidated that is assets and liabilities combined in a single pool to pay creditors Factors that will be relevant in the court s determination include the extent of jointly held property and the amount of jointly owned debts The section of course is not license to consolidate in order to avoid other provisions of the title to the detriment of either the debtors or their creditors It is designed mainly for ease of administration § 303 Involuntary cases a An involuntary case may be commenced only under chapter 7 or 11 of this title and only against a person except a farmer family farmer or a corporation that is not a moneyed business or commercial corporation that may be a debtor under the chapter under which such case is commenced b An involuntary case against a person is commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court of a petition under chapter 7 or 11 of this title — 1 by three or more entities each of which is either a holder of a claim against such person that is not contingent as to liability or the subject of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount or an indenture trustee representing such a holder if such noncontingent undisputed claims aggregate at least $ 10 000 more than the value of any lien on property of the debtor securing such claims held by the holders of such claims 2 if there are fewer than 12 such holders excluding any employee or insider of such person and any transferee of a transfer that is voidable under section 544 545 547 548 549 or 724 a of this title by one or more of such holders that hold in the aggregate at least $ 10 000 of such claims 3 if such person is a partnership — A by fewer than all of the general partners in such partnership or B if relief has been ordered under this title with respect to all of the general partners in such partnership by a general partner in such partnership the trustee of such a general partner or a holder of a claim against such partnership or 4 by a foreign representative of the estate in a foreign proceeding concerning such person c After the filing of a petition under this section but before the case is dismissed or relief is ordered a creditor holding an unsecured claim that is not contingent other than a creditor filing under subsection b of this section may join in the petition with the same effect as if such joining creditor were a petitioning creditor under subsection b of this section d The debtor or a general partner in a partnership debtor that did not join in the petition may file an answer to a petition under this section e After notice and a hearing and for cause the court may require the petitioners under this section to file a bond to indemnify the debtor for such amounts as the court may later allow under subsection i of this section f Notwithstanding section 363 of this title except to the extent that the court orders otherwise and until an order for relief in the case any business of the debtor may continue to operate and the debtor may continue to use acquire or dispose of property as if an involuntary case concerning the debtor had not been commenced g At any time after the commencement of an involuntary case under chapter 7 of this title but before an order for relief in the case the court on request of a party in interest after notice to the debtor and a hearing and if necessary to preserve the property of the estate or to prevent loss to the estate may order the United States trustee to appoint an interim trustee under section 701 of this title to take possession of the property of the estate and to operate any business of the debtor Before an order for relief the debtor may regain possession of property in the possession of a trustee ordered appointed under this subsection if the debtor files such bond as the court requires conditioned on the debtor s accounting for and delivering to the trustee if there is an order for relief in the case such property or the value as of the date the debtor regains possession of such property h If the petition is not timely controverted the court shall order relief against the debtor in an involuntary case under the chapter under which the petition was filed Otherwise after trial the court shall order relief against the debtor in an involuntary case under the chapter under which the petition was filed only if — 1 the debtor is generally not paying such debtor s debts as such debts become due unless such debts are the subject of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount or 2 within 120 days before the date of the filing of the petition a custodian other than a trustee receiver or agent appointed or authorized to take charge of less than substantially all of the property of the debtor for the purpose of enforcing a lien against such property was appointed or took possession i If the court dismisses a petition under this section other than on consent of all petitioners and the debtor and if the debtor does not waive the right to judgment under this subsection the court may grant judgment — 1 against the petitioners and in favor of the debtor for — A costs or B a reasonable attorney s fee or 2 against any petitioner that filed the petition in bad faith for — A any damages proximately caused by such filing or B punitive damages j Only after notice to all creditors and a hearing may the court dismiss a petition filed under this section — 1 on the motion of a petitioner 2 on consent of all petitioners and the debtor or 3 for want of prosecution k 1 If — A the petition under this section is false or contains any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement B the debtor is an individual and C the court dismisses such petition the court upon the motion of the debtor shall seal all the

prohibiting all consumer reporting agencies as defined in section 603 f of the Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 U S C 1681a f from making any consumer report as defined in section 603 d of that Act that contains any information relating to such petition or to the case commenced by the filing of such petition 3 Upon the expiration of the statute of limitations described in section 3282 of title 18 for

For adjustment of certain dollar amounts specified in this section that is not reflected in text see Adjustment of Dollar Amounts note below Historical and Revision Notes legislative statements Section 303 b 1 is modified to make clear that unsecured claims against the debtor must be determined by taking into account liens securing property held by third parties Section 303 b 3 adopts a provision contained in the Senate amendment indicating that an involuntary petition may be commenced against a partnership by fewer than all of the general partners in such partnership Such action may be taken by fewer than all of the general partners notwithstanding a contrary agreement between the partners or State or local law Section 303 h 1 in the House amendment is a compromise of standards found in H R 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate amendment pertaining to the standards that must be met in order to obtain an order for relief in an involuntary case under title 11 The language specifies that the court will order such relief only if the debtor is generally not paying debtor s debts as they become due Section 303 h 2 reflects a compromise pertaining to section 543 of title 11 relating to turnover of property by a custodian It provides an alternative test to support an order for relief in an involuntary case If a custodian other than a trustee receiver or agent appointed or authorized to take charge of less than substantially all of the property of the debtor for the purpose of enforcing a lien against such property was appointed or took possession within 120 days before the date of the filing of the petition then the court may order relief in the involuntary case The test under section 303 h 2 differs from section 3a 5 of the Bankruptcy Act [ section 21 a 5 of former title 11 ] which requires an involuntary case to be commenced before the earlier of time such custodian was appointed or took possession The test in section 303 h 2 authorizes an order for relief to be entered in an involuntary case from the later date on which the custodian was appointed or took possession senate report no 95 – 989 Section 303 governs the commencement of involuntary cases under title 11 An involuntary case may be commenced only under chapter 7 Liquidation or chapter 11 Reorganization Involuntary cases are not permitted for municipalities because to do so may constitute an invasion of State sovereignty contrary to the 10th amendment and would constitute bad policy by permitting the fate of a municipality governed by officials elected by the people of the municipality to be determined by a small number of creditors of the municipality Involuntary chapter 13 cases are not permitted either To do so would constitute bad policy because chapter 13 only works when there is a willing debtor that wants to repay his creditors Short of involuntary servitude it is difficult to keep a debtor working for his creditors when he does not want to pay them back See chapter 3 supra The exceptions contained in current law that prohibit involuntary cases against farmers ranchers and eleemosynary institutions are continued Farmers and ranchers are excepted because of the cyclical nature of their business One drought year or one year of low prices as a result of which a farmer is temporarily unable to pay his creditors should not subject him to involuntary bankruptcy Eleemosynary institutions such as churches schools and charitable organizations and foundations likewise are exempt from involuntary bankruptcy The provisions for involuntary chapter 11 cases is a slight change from present law based on the proposed consolidation of the reorganization chapters Currently involuntary cases are permitted under chapters X and XII [ chapters 10 and 12 of former title 11 ] but not under chapter XI [ chapter 11 of former title 11 ] The consolidation requires a single rule for all kinds of reorganization proceedings Because the assets of an insolvent debtor belong equitably to his creditors the bill permits involuntary cases in order that creditors may realize on their assets through reorganization as well as through liquidation Subsection b of the section specifies who may file an involuntary petition As under current law if the debtor has more than 12 creditors three creditors must join in the involuntary petition The dollar amount limitation is changed from current law to $ 5 000 The new amount applies both to liquidation and reorganization cases in order that there not be an artificial difference between the two chapters that would provide an incentive for one or the other Subsection b 1 makes explicit the right of an indenture trustee to be one of the three petitioning creditors on behalf of the creditors the trustee represents under the indenture If all of the general partners in a partnership are in bankruptcy then the trustee of a single general partner may file an involuntary petition against the partnership Finally a foreign representative may file an involuntary case concerning the debtor in the foreign proceeding in order to administer assets in this country This subsection is not intended to overrule Bankruptcy Rule 104 d which places certain restrictions on the transfer of claims for the purpose of commencing an involuntary case That Rule will be continued under section 405 d of this bill Subsection c permits creditors other than the original petitioning creditors to join in the petition with the same effect as if the joining creditor had been one of the original petitioning creditors Thus if the claim of one of the original petitioning creditors is disallowed the case will not be dismissed for want of three creditors or want of $ 5 000 in petitioning claims if the joining creditor suffices to fulfill the statutory requirements Subsection d permits the debtor to file an answer to an involuntary petition The subsection also permits a general partner in a partnership debtor to answer an involuntary petition against the partnership if he did not join in the petition Thus a partnership petition by less than all of the general partners is treated as an involuntary not a voluntary petition The court may under subsection e require the petitioners to file a bond to indemnify the debtor for such amounts as the court may later allow under subsection i Subsection i provides for costs attorneys fees and damages in certain circumstances The bonding requirement will discourage frivolous petitions as well as spiteful petitions based on a desire to embarrass the debtor who may be a competitor of a petitioning creditor or to put the debtor out of business without good cause An involuntary petition may put a debtor out of business even if it is without foundation and is later dismissed Subsection f is both a clarification and a change from existing law It permits the debtor to continue to operate any business of the debtor and to dispose of property as if the case had not been commenced The court is permitted however to control the debtor s powers under this subsection by appropriate orders such as where there is a fear that the debtor may attempt to abscond with assets dispose of them at less than their fair value or dismantle his business all to the detriment of the debtor s creditors The court may also under subsection g appoint an interim trustee to take possession of the debtor s property and to operate any business of the debtor pending trial on the involuntary petition The court may make such an order only on the request of a party in interest and after notice to the debtor and a hearing There must be a showing that a trustee is necessary to preserve the property of the estate or to prevent loss to the estate The debtor may regain possession by posting a sufficient bond Subsection h provides the standard for an order for relief on an involuntary petition If the petition is not timely controverted the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure will fix time limits the court orders relief after a trial only if the debtor is generally unable to pay its debts as they mature or if the debtor has failed to pay a major portion of his debts as they become due or if a custodian was appointed during the 90 day period preceding the filing of the petition The first two tests are variations of the equity insolvency test They represent the most significant departure from present law concerning the grounds for involuntary bankruptcy which requires an act of bankruptcy Proof of the commission of an act of bankruptcy has frequently required a showing that the debtor was insolvent on a balance sheet test when the act was committed This bill abolishes the concept of acts of bankruptcy The equity insolvency test has been in equity jurisprudence for hundreds of years and though it is new in the bankruptcy context except in chapter X [ chapter 10 of former title 11 ] the bankruptcy courts should have no difficulty in applying it The third test appointment of a custodian within ninety days before the petition is provided for simplicity It is not a partial re enactment of acts of bankruptcy If a custodian of all or substantially all of the property of the debtor has been appointed this paragraph creates an irrebuttable presumption that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as they mature Moreover once a proceeding to liquidate assets has been commenced the debtor s creditors have an absolute right to have the liquidation or reorganization proceed in the bankruptcy court and under the bankruptcy laws with all of the appropriate creditor and debtor protections that those laws provide Ninety days gives creditors ample time in which to seek bankruptcy liquidation after the appointment of a custodian If they wait beyond the ninety day period they are not precluded from filing an involuntary petition They are simply required to prove equity insolvency rather than the more easily provable custodian test Subsection i permits the court to award costs reasonable attorney s fees or damages if an involuntary petition is dismissed other than by consent of all petitioning creditors and the debtor The damages that the court may award are those that may be caused by the taking of possession of the debtor s property under subsection g or section 1104 of the bankruptcy code In addition if a petitioning creditor filed the petition in bad faith the court may award the debtor any damages proximately caused by the filing of the petition These damages may include such items as loss of business during and after the pendency of the case and so on Or is not exclusive in this paragraph The court may grant any or all of the damages provided for under the provision Dismissal in the best interests of credits under section 305 a 1 would not give rise to a damages claim Under subsection j the court may dismiss the petition by consent only after giving notice to all creditors The purpose of the subsection is to prevent collusive settlements among the debtor and the petitioning creditors while other creditors that wish to see relief ordered with respect to the debtor but that did not participate in the case are left without sufficient protection Subsection k governs involuntary cases against foreign banks that are not engaged in business in the United States but that have assets located here The subsection prevents a foreign bank from being placed into bankruptcy in this country unless a foreign proceeding against the bank is pending The special protection afforded by this section is needed to prevent creditors from effectively closing down a foreign bank by the commencement of an involuntary bankruptcy case in this country unless that bank is involved in a proceeding under foreign law An involuntary case commenced under this subsection gives the foreign representative an alternative to commencing a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding under section 304 Amendments 2010 — Subsecs k

that has frequently been rejected by the common law in other contexts However the bankruptcy court is permitted under section 306 to condition any relief under section 303 304 or 305 on the compliance by the foreign representative with the orders of the bankruptcy court The last provision is not carte blanche to the bankruptcy court to require the foreign representative to submit to jurisdiction in

326 a of the House amendment modifies a provision as contained in H R 8200 as passed by the House The percentage limitation on the fees of a trustee contained in the House bill is retained but no additional percentage is specified for cases in which a trustee operates the business of the debtor Section 326 b of the Senate amendment is deleted as an unnecessary restatement of the limitation contained in section 326 a as modified The provision contained in section 326 a of the Senate amendment authorizing a trustee to receive a maximum fee of $ 150 regardless of the availability of assets in the estate is deleted It will not be necessary in view of the increase in section 326 a and the doubling of the minimum fee as provided in section 330 b Section 326 b of the House amendment derives from section 326 c of H R 8200 as passed by the House It is a conforming amendment to indicate a change with respect to the selection of a trustee in a chapter 13 case under section 1302 a of title 11 senate report no 95 – 989 This section is derived in part from section 48c of the Bankruptcy Act [ section 76 c of former title 11 ] It must be emphasized that this section does not authorize compensation of trustees This section simply fixes the maximum compensation of a trustee Proposed 11 U S C 330 authorizes and fixes the standard of compensation Under section 48c of current law the maximum limits have tended to become minimums in many cases This section is not intended to be so interpreted The limits in this section together with the limitations found in section 330 are to be applied as outer limits and not as grants or entitlements to the maximum fees specified The maximum fee schedule is derived from section 48c 1 of the present act [ section 76 c 1 of former title 11 ] but with a change relating to the bases on which the percentage maxima are computed The maximum fee schedule is based on decreasing percentages of increasing amounts The amounts are the amounts of money distributed by the trustee to parties in interest excluding the debtor but including secured creditors These amounts were last amended in 1952 Since then the cost of living has approximately doubled Thus the bases were doubled It should be noted that the bases on which the maximum fee is computed includes moneys turned over to secured creditors to cover the situation where the trustee liquidates property subject to a lien and distributes the proceeds It does not cover cases in which the trustee simply turns over the property to the secured creditor nor where the trustee abandons the property and the secured creditor is permitted to foreclose The provision is also subject to the rights of the secured creditor generally under proposed section 506 especially 506 c The $ 150 discretionary fee provision of current law is retained Subsection b of this section entitles an operating trustee to a reasonable fee without any limitation based on the maximum provided for a liquidating trustee as in current law Bankruptcy Act § 48c 2 [ section 76 c 2 of former title 11 ] Subsection c [ enacted as b ] permits a maximum fee of five percent on all payments to creditors under a chapter 13 plan to the trustee appointed in the case Subsection d [ enacted as c ] provides a limitation not found in current law Even if more than one trustee serves in the case the maximum fee payable to all trustees does not change For example if an interim trustee is appointed and an elected trustee replaces him the combined total of the fees payable to the interim trustee and the permanent trustee may not exceed the amount specified in this section Under current law very often a receiver receives a full fee and a subsequent trustee also receives a full fee The resultant double dipping especially in cases in which the receiver and the trustee are the same individual is detrimental to the interests of creditors by needlessly increasing the cost of administering bankruptcy estates Subsection e [ enacted as d ] permits the court to deny compensation to a trustee if the trustee has been derelict in his duty by employing counsel who is not disinterested Amendments 1994 — Subsec a Pub L 103 – 394 substituted 25 percent on the first $ 5 000 or less 10 percent on any amount in excess of $ 5 000 but not in excess of $ 50 000 5 percent on any amount in excess of $ 50 000

contained in the Senate amendment indicating that an attorney for the debtor in possession is not disqualified for compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses simply because of prior representation of the debtor senate report no 95 – 989 This section which is parallel to section 326 fixes the maximum compensation allowable to a professional person employed under section 327 It authorizes the trustee with the court s approval to employ professional persons on any reasonable terms including on a retainer on an hourly or on a contingent fee basis Subsection a further permits the court to allow compensation different from the compensation provided under the trustee s agreement if the prior agreement proves to have been improvident in light of development unanticipatable at the time of the agreement The court s power includes the power to increase as well as decrease the agreed upon compensation This provision is permissive not mandatory and should not be used by the court if to do so would violate the code of ethics of the professional involved Subsection b limits a trustee that has been authorized to serve as his own counsel to only one fee for each service The purpose of permitting the trustee to serve as his own counsel is to reduce costs It is not included to provide the trustee with a bonus by permitting him to receive two fees for the same service or to avoid the maxima fixed in section 326 Thus this subsection requires the court to differentiate between the trustee s services as trustee and his services as trustee s counsel and to fix compensation accordingly Services that a trustee normally performs for an estate without assistance of counsel are to be compensated under the limits fixed in section 326 Only services that he performs that are normally performed by trustee s counsel may be compensated under the maxima imposed by this section Subsection c permits the court to deny compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses if the professional person is not disinterested or if he represents or holds an interest adverse to the estate on the matter on which he is employed The subsection provides a penalty for conflicts of

former title 11 ] requires the debtor s attorney to file with the court a statement of the compensation paid or agreed to be paid to the attorney for services in contemplation of and in connection with the case and the source of the compensation Payments to a debtor s attorney provide serious potential for evasion of creditor protection provisions of the bankruptcy laws and serious potential for overreaching by the debtor s attorney and should be subject to careful scrutiny Subsection b permits the court to deny compensation to the attorney to cancel an agreement to pay compensation or to order the return of compensation paid if the compensation exceeds the reasonable value of the services provided The return of payments already made are generally to the trustee for the benefit of the

contrary standard contained in the Senate amendment Attorneys fees in bankruptcy cases can be quite large and should be closely examined by the court However bankruptcy legal services are entitled to command the same competency of counsel as other cases In that light the policy of this section is to compensate attorneys and other professionals serving in a case under title 11 at the same rate as the attorney or other professional would be compensated for performing comparable services other than in a case under title 11 Contrary language in the Senate report accompanying S 2266 is rejected and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company v Brock 405 F 2d 429 432 5th Cir 1968 is overruled Notions of economy of the estate in fixing fees are outdated and have no place in a bankruptcy code Section 330 a 2 of the Senate amendment is deleted although the Securities and Exchange Commission retains a right to file an advisory report under section 1109 Section 330 b of the Senate amendment is deleted as unnecessary as the limitations contained therein are covered by section 328 c of H R 8200 as passed by the House and contained in the House amendment Section 330 c of the Senate amendment providing for a trustee to receive a fee of $ 20 for each estate from the filing fee paid to the clerk is retained as section 330 b of the House amendment The section will encourage private trustees to serve in cases under title 11 and in pilot districts will place less of a burden on the U S trustee to serve in no asset cases Section 330 b of H R 8200 as passed by the House is retained by the House amendment as section 330 c [ section 15330 ] senate report no 95 – 989 Section 330 authorizes the court to award compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses of officers of the estate and other professionals The compensation is to be reasonable for economy in administration is the basic objective Compensation is to be for actual necessary services based on the time spent the nature the extent and the value of the services rendered and the cost of comparable services in nonbankruptcy cases There are the criteria that have been applied by the courts as analytic aids in defining reasonable compensation The reference to the cost of comparable services in a nonbankruptcy case is not intended as a change of existing law In a bankruptcy case fees are not a matter for private agreement There is inherent a public interest that must be considered in awarding fees Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co v Brock 405 F 2d 429 432 C A 5 1968 cert denied 395 U S 906 1969 An allowance is the result of a balance struck between moderation in the interest of the estate and its security holders and the need to be generous enough to encourage lawyers and others to render the necessary and exacting services that bankruptcy cases often require In re Yale Express System Inc 366 F Supp 1376 1381 S D N Y 1973 The rates for similar kinds of services in private employment is one element among others in that balance Compensation in private employment noted in subsection a is a point of reference not a controlling determinant of what shall be allowed in bankruptcy cases One of the major reforms in 1938 especially for reorganization cases was centralized control over fees in the bankruptcy courts See Brown v Gerdes 321 U S 178 182 – 184 1944 Leiman v Guttman 336 U S 1 4 – 9 1949 It was intended to guard against a recurrence of the many sordid chapters in the history of fees in corporate reorganizations Dickinson Industrial Site Inc v Cowan 309 U S 382 388 1940 In the years since then the bankruptcy bar has flourished and prospered and persons of merit and quality have not eschewed public service in bankruptcy cases merely because bankruptcy courts in the interest of economy in administration have not allowed them compensation that may be earned in the private economy of business or the professions There is no reason to believe that in generations to come their successors will be less persuaded by the need to serve in the public interest because of stronger allures of private gain elsewhere Subsection a provides for compensation of paraprofessionals in order to reduce the cost of administering bankruptcy cases Paraprofessionals can be employed to perform duties which do not require the full range of skills of a qualified professional Some courts have not hesitated to recognize paraprofessional services as compensable under existing law An explicit provision to that effect is useful and constructive The last sentence of subsection a provides that in the case of a public company — defined in section 1101 3 — the court shall refer after a hearing all applications to the Securities and Exchange Commission for a report which shall be advisory only In Chapter X cases in which the Commission has appeared it generally filed reports on fee applications Usually courts have accorded the SEC s views substantial weight as representing the opinion of a disinterested agency skilled and experienced in reorganization affairs The last sentence intends for the advisory assistance of the Commission to be sought only in case of a public company in reorganization under chapter 11 Subsection b reenacts section 249 of Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act [ former ] 11 U S C 649 It is a codification of equitable principles designed to prevent fiduciaries in the case from engaging in the specified transactions since they are in a position to gain inside information or to shape or influence the course of the reorganization Wolf v Weinstein 372 U S 633 1963 The statutory bar of compensation and reimbursement is based on the principle that such transactions involve conflicts of interest Private gain undoubtedly prompts the purchase or sale of claims or stock interests while the fiduciary s obligation is to render loyal and disinterested service which his position of trust has imposed upon him Subsection b extends to a trustee his attorney committees and their attorneys or any other persons acting in the case in a representative or fiduciary capacity It bars compensation to any of the foregoing who after assuming to act in such capacity has purchased or sold directly or indirectly claims against or stock in the debtor The bar is absolute It makes no difference whether the transaction brought a gain or loss or neither and the court is not authorized to approve a purchase or sale before or after the transaction The exception is for an acquisition or transfer otherwise than by a voluntary purchase or sale such as an acquisition by bequest See Otis & Co v Insurance Bldg Corp 110 F 2d 333 335 C A 1 1940 Subsection c [ enacted as b ] is intended for no asset liquidation cases where minimal compensation for trustees is needed The sum of $ 20 will be allowed in each case which is double the amount provided under current law house report no 95 – 595 Section 330 authorizes compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses of officers of the estate It also prescribes the standards on which the amount of compensation is to be determined As noted above the compensation allowable under this section is subject to the maxima set out in sections 326 328 and 329 The compensation is to be reasonable for actual necessary services rendered based on the time the nature the extent and the value of the services rendered and on the cost of comparable services other than in a case under the bankruptcy code The effect of the last provision is to overrule In re Beverly Crest Convalescent Hospital Inc 548 F 2d 817 9th Cir 1976 as amended 1977 which set an arbitrary limit on fees payable based on the amount of a district judge s salary and other similar cases that require fees to be determined based on notions of conservation of the estate and economy of administration If that case were allowed to stand attorneys that could earn much higher incomes in other fields would leave the bankruptcy arena Bankruptcy specialists who enable the system to operate smoothly efficiently and expeditiously would be driven elsewhere and the bankruptcy field would be occupied by those who could not find other work and those who practice bankruptcy law only occasionally almost as a public service Bankruptcy fees that are lower than fees in other areas of the legal profession may operate properly when the attorneys appearing in bankruptcy cases do so intermittently because a low fee in a small segment of a practice can be absorbed by other work Bankruptcy specialists however if required to accept fees in all of their cases that are consistently lower than fees they could receive elsewhere will not remain in the bankruptcy field This subsection provides for reimbursement of actual necessary expenses It further provides for compensation of paraprofessionals employed by professional persons employed by the estate of the debtor The provision is included to reduce the cost of administering bankruptcy cases In nonbankruptcy areas attorneys are able to charge for a paraprofessional s time on an hourly basis and not include it in overhead If a similar practice does not pertain in bankruptcy cases then the attorney will be less inclined to use paraprofessionals even where the work involved could easily be handled by an attorney s assistant at much lower cost to the estate This provision is designed to encourage attorneys to use paraprofessional assistance where possible and to insure that the estate not the attorney will bear the cost to the benefit of both the estate and the attorneys

debtor to appear at the meeting of creditors and submit to examination under oath The purpose of the examination is to enable creditors and the trustee to determine if assets have improperly been disposed of or concealed or if there are grounds for objection to discharge The scope of the examination under this section will be governed by the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure as it is today See rules 205 d 10 – 213 c and 11 – 26 It is expected that the scope prescribed by these rules for liquidation cases that is only the debtor s acts conduct or property or any matter that may affect the administration of the estate or the debtor s right to discharge will remain substantially unchanged In reorganization cases the examination would be broader including inquiry into the liabilities and financial condition of the debtor the operation of his business and the desirability of the continuance thereof and other matters relevant to the case and to the formulation of the plan Examination of

incrimination immunity Immunity for persons required to submit to examination to testify or to provide information in a case under this title may be granted under part V of title 18 Pub L 95 – 598 Nov 6 1978 92 Stat 2565 Historical and Revision Notes senate report no 95 – 989 Part V [§ 6001 et seq ] of title 18 of the United States Code governs the granting of immunity to witnesses before Federal tribunals The immunity provided under part V is only use immunity not transactional immunity Part V applies to all proceedings before Federal courts before Federal grand juries before administrative agencies and before Congressional committees It requires the Attorney General or the U S attorney to request or to approve any grant of immunity whether before a court grand jury agency or congressional committee This section carries part V over into bankruptcy cases Thus for a witness to be ordered to testify before a bankruptcy court in spite of a claim of privilege the U S attorney for the district in which the court sits would have to request from the district court for that district the immunity order The rule would apply to both debtors creditors and any other witnesses in a bankruptcy case If the immunity were granted the witness would be required to testify If not he could claim the privilege against self incrimination Part V is a significant departure from current law Under section 7a 10 of the Bankruptcy Act [ section 25 a 10 of former title 11 ] a debtor is required to testify in all circumstances but any testimony he gives may not be used against him in any criminal proceeding except testimony given in any hearing on objections to discharge With that exception section 7a 10 amounts to a blanket grant of use immunity to all debtors Immunity for other witnesses in bankruptcy courts today is governed by part V of title 18 The consequences of a claim of privileges by a debtor under proposed law and under current law differ as well Under section 14c 6 of current law [ section 32 c 6 of former title 11 ] any refusal to answer a material question approved by the court will result in the denial of a discharge even if the refusal is based on the privilege against self incrimination Thus the debtor is confronted with the choice between losing his discharge and opening himself up to possible criminal prosecution Under section 727 a 6 of the proposed title 11 a debtor is only denied a discharge if he refuses to testify after having been granted immunity If the debtor claims the privilege and the U S attorney does not request immunity from the district courts then the debtor may refuse to testify and still retain his right to a discharge It removes the Scylla and Charibdis choice for debtors that exists under the Bankruptcy Act [ former title 11 ] § 345 Money of estates a A trustee in a case under this title may make such deposit or investment of the money of the estate for which such trustee serves as will yield the maximum reasonable net return on such money taking into account the safety of such deposit or investment b Except with respect to a deposit or investment that is insured or guaranteed by the United States or by a department agency or instrumentality of the United States or backed by the full faith and credit of the United States the trustee shall require from an entity with which such money is deposited or invested — 1 a bond — A in favor of the United States B secured by the undertaking of a corporate surety approved by the United States trustee for the district in which the case is pending and C

amendment moves section 345 c of the House bill to chapter 15 as part of the pilot program for the U S trustees The bond required by section 345 b may be a blanket bond posted by the financial depository sufficient to cover deposits by trustees in several cases as is done under current law senate report no 95 – 989 This section is a significant departure from section 61 of the Bankruptcy Act [ section 101 of former title 11 ] It permits a trustee in a bankruptcy case to make such deposit of investment of the money of the estate for which he serves as will yield the maximum reasonable net return on the money taking into account the safety of such deposit or investment Under current law the trustee is permitted to deposit money only with banking institutions Thus the trustee is generally unable to secure a high rate of return on money of estates pending distribution to the detriment of creditors Under this section the trustee may make deposits in savings and loans may purchase government bonds or make such other deposit or investment as is appropriate Under proposed 11 U S C 541 a 6 and except as provided in subsection c of this section any interest or gain realized on the deposit or investment of funds under this section will become property of the estate and will thus enhance the recovery of creditors In order to protect the creditors subsection b requires certain precautions against loss of the money so deposited or invested The trustee must require from a person with which he deposits or invests money of an estate a bond in favor of the United States secured by approved corporate surety and conditioned on a proper accounting for all money deposited or invested and for any return on such money Alternately the trustee may require the deposit of securities of the kind specified in section 15 of title 6 of the United States Code [ 31 U S C 9303 ] which governs the posting of security by banks that receive public moneys on deposit These bonding requirements do not apply to deposits or investments that are insured or guaranteed the United States or a department agency or instrumentality of the United States or that are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States These provisions do not address the question of aggregation of funds by a private chapter 13 trustee and are not to be construed as excluding such possibility The Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure may provide for aggregation under appropriate circumstances and adequate safeguards in cases where there is a significant need such as in districts in which there is a standing chapter 13 trustee In such case the interest or return on the funds would help defray the cost of administering the cases in which the standing trustee serves Amendments 1994

comment on these special tax provisions prior to their revision Special tax provisions State and local rules This section provides special tax provisions dealing with the treatment under State or local but not Federal tax law of the method of taxing bankruptcy estates of individuals partnerships and corporations survival and allocation of tax attributes between the bankrupt and the estate return filing requirements and the tax treatment of income from discharge of indebtedness The Senate bill removed these rules pending adoption of Federal rules on these issues in the next Congress The House amendment returns the State and local tax rules to section 346 so that they may be studied by the bankruptcy and tax bars who may wish to submit comments to Congress Withholding rules Both the House bill and Senate amendment provide that the trustee is required to comply with the normal withholding rules applicable to the payment of wages and other payments The House amendment retains this rule for State and local taxes only The treatment of withholding of Federal taxes will be considered in the next Congress Section 726 of the Senate amendment provides that the rule requiring pro rata payment of all expenses within a priority category does not apply to the payment of amounts withheld by a bankruptcy trustee The purpose of this rule was to insure that the trustee pay the full amount of the withheld taxes to the appropriate governmental tax authority The House amendment deletes this rule as unnecessary because the existing practice conforms essentially to that rule If the trustee fails to pay over in full amounts that he withheld it is a violation of his trustee s duties which would permit the taxing authority to sue the trustee on his bond When taxes considered incurred The Senate amendment contained rules of general application dealing with when a tax is incurred for purposes of the various tax collection rules affecting the debtor and the estate The House amendment adopts the substance of these rules and transfers them to section 507 of title 11 Penalty for failure to pay tax The Senate amendment contains a rule which relieves the debtor and the trustee from certain tax penalties for failure to make timely payment of a tax to the extent that the bankruptcy rules prevent the trustee or the debtor from paying the tax on time Since most of these penalties relate to Federal taxes the House amendment deletes these rules pending consideration of Federal tax rules affecting bankruptcy in the next Congress senate report no 95 – 989 Subsection a indicates that subsections b c d e g h i and j apply notwithstanding any State or local tax law but are subject to Federal tax law Subsection b 1 provides that in a case concerning an individual under chapter 7 or 11 of title 11 income of the estate is taxable only to the estate and not to the debtor The second sentence of the paragraph provides that if such individual is a partner the tax attributes of the partnership are distributable to the partner s estate rather than to the partner except to the extent that section 728 of title 11 provides otherwise Subsection b 2 states a general rule that the estate of an individual is to be taxed as an estate The paragraph is made subject to the remainder of section 346 and section 728 of title 11 Subsection b 3 requires the accounting method but not necessarily the accounting period of the estate to be the same as the method used by the individual debtor Subsection c 1 states a general rule that the estate of a partnership or a corporated debtor is not a separate entity for tax purposes The income of the debtor is to be taxed as if the case were not commenced except as provided in the remainder of section 346 and section 728 Subsection c 2 requires the trustee except as provided in section 728 of title 11 to file all tax returns on behalf of the partnership or corporation during the case Subsection d indicates that the estate in a chapter 13 case is not a separate taxable entity and that all income of the estate is to be taxed to the debtor Subsection e establishes a business deduction consisting of allowed expenses of administration except for tax or capital expenses that are not otherwise deductible The deduction may be used by the estate when it is a separate taxable entity or by the entity to which the income of the estate is taxed when it is not Subsection f imposes a duty on the trustee to comply with any Federal State or local tax law requiring withholding or collection of taxes from any payment of wages salaries commissions dividends interest or other payments Any amount withheld is to be paid to the taxing authority at the same time and with the same priority as the claim from which such amount withheld was paid Subsection g 1 A indicates that neither gain nor loss is recognized on the transfer by law of property from the debtor or a creditor to the estate Subparagraph B provides a similar policy if the property of the estate is returned from the estate to the debtor other than by a sale of property to debtor Subparagraph C also provides for nonrecognition of gain or loss in a case under chapter 11 if a corporate debtor transfers property to a successor corporation or to an affiliate under a joint plan An exception is made to enable a taxing authority to cause recognition of gain or loss to the extent provided in IRC [ title 26 ] section 371 as amended by section 109 of this bill Subsection g 2 provides that any of the three kinds of transferees specified in paragraph 1 take the property with the same character holding period and basis in the hands of the transferor at the time of such transfer The transferor s basis may be adjusted under section 346 j 5 even if the discharge of indebtedness occurs after the transfer of property Of course no adjustment will occur if the transfer is from the debtor to the estate or if the transfer is from an entity that is not discharged Subsection h provides that the creation of the estate of an individual under chapter 7 or 11 of title 11 as a separate taxable entity does not affect the number of taxable years for purposes of computing loss carryovers or carrybacks The section applies with respect to carryovers or carrybacks of the debtor transferred into the estate under section 346 i 1 of title 11 or back to the debtor under section 346 i 2 of title 11 Subsection i 1 states a general rule that an estate that is a separate taxable entity nevertheless succeeds to all tax attributes of the debtor The six enumerated attributes are illustrative and not exhaustive Subsection i 2 indicates that attributes passing from the debtor into an estate that is a separate taxable entity will return to the debtor if unused by the estate The debtor is permitted to use any such attribute as though the case had not been commenced Subsection i 3 permits an estate that is a separate taxable entity to carryback losses of the estate to a taxable period of the debtor that ended before the case was filed The estate is treated as if it were the debtor with respect to time limitations and other restrictions The section makes clear that the debtor may not carryback any loss of his own from a tax year during the pendency of the case to such a period until the case is closed No tolling of any period of limitation is provided with respect to carrybacks by the debtor of post petition losses Subsection j sets forth seven special rules treating with the tax effects of forgiveness or discharge of indebtedness The terms forgiveness and discharge are redundant but are used to clarify that discharge in the context of a special tax provision in title 11 includes forgiveness of indebtedness whether or not such indebtedness is discharged in the bankruptcy sense Paragraph 1 states the general rule that forgiveness of indebtedness is not taxable except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 2 – 7 The paragraph is patterned after sections 268 395 and 520 of the Bankruptcy Act [ sections 668 795 and 920 of former title 11 ] Paragraph 2 disallows deductions for liabilities of a deductible nature in any year during or after the year of cancellation of such liabilities For the purposes of this paragraph a deduction with respect to a liability includes a capital loss incurred on the disposition of a capital asset with respect to a liability that was incurred in connection with the acquisition of such asset Paragraph 3 causes any net operating loss of a debtor that is an individual or corporation to be reduced by any discharge of indebtedness except as provided in paragraphs 2 or 4 If a deduction is disallowed under paragraph 2 then no double counting occurs Thus paragraph 3 will reflect the reduction of losses by liabilities that have been forgiven including deductible liabilities or nondeductible liabilities such as repayment of principal on borrowed funds Paragraph 4 specifically excludes two kinds of indebtedness from reduction of net operating losses under paragraph 3 or from reduction of basis under paragraph 5 Subparagraph A excludes items of a deductible nature that were not deducted or that could not be deducted such as gambling losses or liabilities for interest owed to a relative of the debtor Subparagraph B excludes indebtedness of a debtor that is an individual or corporation that resulted in deductions which did not offset income and that did not contribute to an unexpired net operating loss or loss carryover In these situations the debtor has derived no tax benefit so there is no need to incur an offsetting reduction Paragraph 5 provides a two point test for reduction of basis The paragraph replaces sections 270 396 and 522 of the Bankruptcy Act [ sections 670 796 and 922 of former title 11 ] Subparagraph A sets out the maximum amount by which basis may be reduced — the total indebtedness forgiven less adjustments made under paragraphs 2 and 3 This avoids double counting If a deduction is disallowed under paragraph 2 or a carryover is reduced under paragraph 3 then the tax benefit is neutralized and there is no need to reduce basis Subparagraph B reduces basis to the extent the debtor s total basis of assets before the discharge exceeds total preexisting liabilities still remaining after discharge of indebtedness This is a basis solvency limitation which differs from the usual test of solvency because it measures against the remaining liabilities the benefit aspect of assets their basis rather than their value Paragraph 5 applies so that any transferee of the debtor s property who is required to use the debtor s basis takes the debtor s basis reduced by the lesser of A and B Thus basis will be reduced but never below a level equal to undischarged liabilities Paragraph 6 specifies that basis need not be reduced under paragraph 5 to the extent the debtor treats discharged indebtedness as taxable income This permits the debtor to elect whether to recognize income which may be advantageous if the debtor anticipates subsequent net operating losses rather than to reduce basis Paragraph 7 establishes two rules excluding from the category of discharged indebtedness certain indebtedness that is exchanged for an equity security issued under a plan or that is forgiven as a contribution to capital by an equity security holder Subparagraph A creates the first exclusion to the extent indebtedness consisting of items not of a deductible nature is exchanged for an equity security other than the interests of a limited partner in a limited partnership issued by the debtor or is forgiven as a contribution to capital by an equity security holder Subparagraph B excludes indebtedness consisting of items of a deductible nature if the exchange of stock for debts has the same effect as a cash payment equal to the value of the equity security in the amount of the fair market value of the equity security or if less the extent to which such exchange has such effect The two provisions treat the debtor as if it had originally issued stock instead of debt Subparagraph B rectifies the inequity under current law between a cash basis and accrual basis debtor concerning the issuance of stock in exchange for previous services rendered that were of a greater value than the stock Subparagraph B also changes current law by taxing forgiveness of indebtedness to the extent that stock is exchanged for the accrued interest component of a security because the recipient of such stock would not be regarded as having received money under the Carman doctrine References in Text The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 referred to in text is classified generally to Title 26 Internal Revenue Code Amendments 2005 — Pub

chapter Subsection c specifies that notice is to be given of the conversion order the same as notice was given of the order for relief and that the time the trustee or debtor in possession has for assuming or rejecting executory contracts recommences thus giving an opportunity for a newly appointed trustee to familiarize himself with the case Subsection d provides for special treatment of

adequate protection is required under section 362 363 or 364 of this title of an interest of an entity in property such adequate protection may be provided by — 1 requiring the trustee to make a cash payment or periodic cash payments to such entity to the extent that the stay under section 362 of this title use sale or lease under section 363 of this title or any grant of a lien under section 364 of this title results in a decrease in the value of such entity s interest in such property 2 providing to such entity an additional or replacement lien to the extent that such stay use sale lease or grant results in a decrease in the value of such entity s interest in such property or 3 granting such other relief other than entitling such entity to compensation allowable under section 503 b 1 of this title as an administrative expense as will result in the realization by such entity of the indubitable equivalent of such entity s interest in such property Pub L 95 – 598 Nov 6 1978 92 Stat 2569 Pub L 98 – 353 title III § 440 July 10 1984 98 Stat 370 Historical and Revision Notes legislative statements Section 361 of the House amendment represents a compromise between H R 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate amendment regarding the issue of adequate protection of a secured party The House amendment deletes the provision found in section 361 3 of H R 8200 as passed by the House It would have permitted adequate protection to be provided by giving the secured party an administrative expense regarding any decrease in the value of such party s collateral In every case there is the uncertainty that the estate will have sufficient property to pay administrative expenses in full Section 361 4 of H R 8200 as passed by the House is modified in section 361 3 of the House amendment to indicate that the court may grant other forms of adequate protection other than an administrative expense which will result in the realization by the secured creditor of the indubitable equivalent of the creditor s interest in property In the special instance where there is a reserve fund maintained under the security agreement such as in the typical bondholder case indubitable equivalent means that the bondholders would be entitled to be protected as to the reserve fund in addition to the regular payments needed to service the debt Adequate protection of an interest of an entity in property is intended to protect a creditor s allowed secured claim To the extent the protection proves to be inadequate after the fact the creditor is entitled to a first priority administrative expense under section 503 b In the special case of a creditor who has elected application of creditor making an election under section 1111 b 2 that creditor is entitled to adequate protection of the creditor s interest in property to the extent of the value of the collateral not to the extent of the creditor s allowed secured claim which is inflated to cover a deficiency as a result of such election senate report no 95 – 989 Sections 362 363 and 364 require in certain circumstances that the court determine in noticed hearings whether the interest of a secured creditor or co owner of property with the debtor is adequately protected in connection with the sale or use of property The interests of which the court may provide protection in the ways described in this section include equitable as well as legal interests For example a right to enforce a pledge and a right to recover property delivered to a debtor under a consignment agreement or an agreement of sale or return are interests that may be entitled to protection This section specifies means by which adequate protection may be provided but to avoid placing the court in an administrative role does not require the court to provide it Instead the trustee or debtor in possession or the creditor will provide or propose a protection method If the party that is affected by the proposed action objects the court will determine whether the protection provided is adequate The purpose of this section is to illustrate means by which it may be provided and to define the limits of the concept The concept of adequate protection is derived from the fifth amendment protection of property interests as enunciated by the Supreme Court See Wright v Union Central Life Ins Co 311 U S 273 1940 Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v Radford 295 U S 555 1935 The automatic stay also provides creditor protection Without it certain creditors would be able to pursue their own remedies against the debtor s property Those who acted first would obtain payment of the claims in preference to and to the detriment of other creditors Bankruptcy is designed to provide an orderly liquidation procedure under which all creditors are treated equally A race of diligence by creditors for the debtor s assets prevents that Subsection a defines the scope of the automatic stay by listing the acts that are stayed by the commencement of the case The commencement or continuation including the issuance of process of a judicial administrative or other proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the bankruptcy case is stayed under paragraph 1 The scope of this paragraph is broad All proceedings are stayed including arbitration administrative and judicial proceedings Proceeding in this sense encompasses civil actions and all proceedings even if they are not before governmental tribunals The stay is not permanent There is adequate provision for relief from the stay elsewhere in the section However it is important that the trustee have an opportunity to inventory the debtor s position before proceeding with the administration of the case Undoubtedly the court will lift the stay for proceedings before specialized or nongovernmental tribunals to allow those proceedings to come to a conclusion Any party desiring to enforce an order in such a proceeding would thereafter have to come before the bankruptcy court to collect assets Nevertheless it will often be more appropriate to permit proceedings to continue in their place of origin when no great prejudice to the bankruptcy estate would result in order to leave the parties to their chosen forum and to relieve the bankruptcy court from many duties that may be handled elsewhere Paragraph 2 stays the enforcement against the debtor or against property of the estate of a judgment obtained before the commencement of the bankruptcy case Thus execution and levy against the debtors prepetition property are stayed and attempts to collect a judgment from the debtor personally are stayed Paragraph 3 stays any act to obtain possession of property of the estate that is property of the debtor as of the date of the filing of the petition or property from the estate property over which the estate has control or possession The purpose of this provision is to prevent dismemberment of the estate Liquidation must proceed in an orderly fashion Any distribution of property must be by the trustee after he has had an opportunity to familiarize himself with the various rights and interests involved and with the property available for distribution Paragraph 4 stays lien creation against property of the estate Thus taking possession to perfect a lien or obtaining court process is prohibited To permit lien creation after bankruptcy would give certain creditors preferential treatment by making them secured instead of unsecured Paragraph 5 stays any act to create or enforce a lien against property of the debtor that is most property that is acquired after the date of the filing of the petition property that is exempted or property that does not pass to the estate to the extent that the lien secures a prepetition claim Again to permit postbankruptcy lien creation or enforcement would permit certain creditors to receive preferential treatment It may also circumvent the debtors discharge Paragraph 6 prevents creditors from attempting in any way to collect a prepetition debt Creditors in consumer cases occasionally telephone debtors to encourage repayment in spite of bankruptcy Inexperienced frightened or ill counseled debtors may succumb to suggestions to repay notwithstanding their bankruptcy This provision prevents evasion of the purpose of the bankruptcy laws by sophisticated creditors Paragraph 7 stays setoffs of mutual debts and credits between the debtor and creditors As with all other paragraphs of subsection a this paragraph does not affect the right of creditors It simply stays its enforcement pending an orderly examination of the debtor s and creditors rights Subsection b lists seven exceptions to the automatic stay The effect of an exception is not to make the action immune from injunction The court has ample other powers to stay actions not covered by the automatic stay Section 105 of proposed title 11 derived from Bankruptcy Act § 2a 15 [ section 11 a 15 of former title 11 ] grants the power to issue orders necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of title 11 The district court and the bankruptcy court as its adjunct have all the traditional injunctive powers of a court of equity 28 U S C §§ 151 and 164 as proposed in S 2266 § 201 and 28 U S C § 1334 as proposed in S 2266 § 216 Stays or injunctions issued under these other sections will not be automatic upon the commencement of the case but will be granted or issued under the usual rules for the issuance of injunctions By excepting an act or action from the automatic stay the bill simply requires that the trustee move the court into action rather than requiring the stayed party to request relief from the stay There are some actions enumerated in the exceptions that generally should not be stayed automatically upon the commencement of the case for reasons of either policy or practicality Thus the court will have to determine on a case by case basis whether a particular action which may be harming the estate should be stayed With respect to stays issued under other powers or the application of the automatic stay to governmental actions this section and the other sections mentioned are intended to be an express waiver of sovereign immunity of the Federal Government and an assertion of the bankruptcy power over State governments under the supremacy clause notwithstanding a State s sovereign immunity The first exception is of criminal proceedings against the debtor The bankruptcy laws are not a haven for criminal offenders but are designed to give relief from financial overextension Thus criminal actions and proceedings may proceed in spite of bankruptcy Paragraph 2 excepts from the stay the collection of alimony maintenance or support from property that is not property of the estate This will include property acquired after the commencement of the case exempted property and property that does not pass to the estate The automatic stay is one means of protecting the debtor s discharge Alimony maintenance and support obligations are excepted from discharge Staying collection of them when not to the detriment of other creditors because the collection effort is against property that is not property of the estate does not further that goal Moreover it could lead to hardship on the part of the protected spouse or children Paragraph 3 excepts any act to perfect an interest in property to the extent that the trustee s rights and powers are limited under section 546 a of the bankruptcy code That section permits postpetition perfection of certain liens to be effective against the trustee If the act of perfection such as filing were stayed the section would be nullified Paragraph 4 excepts commencement or continuation of actions and proceedings by governmental units to enforce police or regulatory powers Thus where a governmental unit is suing a debtor to prevent or stop violation of fraud environmental protection consumer protection safety or similar police or regulatory laws or attempting to fix damages for violation of such a law the action or proceeding is not stayed under the automatic stay Paragraph 5 makes clear that the exception extends to permit an injunction and enforcement of an injunction and to permit the entry of a money judgment but does not extend to permit enforcement of a money judgment Since the assets of the debtor are in the possession and control of the bankruptcy court and since they constitute a fund out of which all creditors are entitled to share enforcement by a governmental unit of a money judgment would give it preferential treatment to the detriment of all other creditors Paragraph 6 excepts the setoff of any mutual debt and claim for commodity transactions Paragraph 7 excepts actions by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to foreclose or take possession in a case of a loan insured under the National Housing Act [ 12 U S C 1701 et seq ] A general exception for such loans is found in current sections 263 and 517 [ sections 663 and 917 of former title 11 ] the exception allowed by this paragraph is much more limited Subsection c of section 362 specifies the duration of the automatic stay Paragraph 1 terminates a stay of an act against property of the estate when the property ceases to be property of the estate such as by sale abandonment or exemption It does not terminate the stay against property of the debtor if the property leaves the estate and goes to the debtor Paragraph 2 terminates the stay of any other act on the earliest of the time the case is closed the time the case is dismissed or the time a discharge is granted or denied unless the debtor is a corporation or partnership in a chapter 7 case Subsection c governs automatic termination of the stay Subsections d through g govern termination of the stay by the court on the request of a party in interest Subsection d requires the court upon motion of a party in interest to grant relief from the stay for cause such as by terminating annulling modifying or conditioning the stay The lack of adequate protection of an interest in property is one cause for relief but is not the only cause Other causes might include the lack of any connection with or interference with the pending bankruptcy case Generally proceedings in which the debtor is a fiduciary or involving postpetition activities of the debtor need not be stayed because they bear no relationship to the purpose of the automatic stay which is protection of the debtor and his estate from his creditors Upon the court s finding that the debtor has no equity in the property subject to the stay and that the property is not necessary to an effective reorganization of the debtor the subsection requires the court grant relief from the stay To aid in this determination guidelines are established where the property subject to the stay is real property An exception to the necessary to an effective reorganization requirement is made for real property on which no business is being conducted other than operating the real property and activities incident thereto The intent of this exception is to reach the single asset apartment type cases which involve primarily tax shelter investments and for which the bankruptcy laws have provided a too facile method to relay conditions but not the operating shopping center and hotel cases where attempts at reorganization should be permitted Property in which the debtor has equity but which is not necessary to an effective reorganization of the debtor should be sold under section 363 Hearings under this subsection are given calendar priority to ensure that court congestion will not unduly prejudice the rights of creditors who may be obviously entitled to relief from the operation of the automatic stay Subsection e provides protection that is not always available under present law The subsection sets a time certain within which the bankruptcy court must rule on the adequacy of protection provided for the secured creditor s interest If the court does not rule within 30 days from a request by motion for relief from the stay the stay is automatically terminated with respect to the property in question To accommodate more complex cases the subsection permits the court to make a preliminary ruling after a preliminary hearing After a preliminary hearing the court may continue the stay only if there is a reasonable likelihood that the party opposing relief from the stay will prevail at the final hearing Because the stay is essentially an injunction the three stages of the stay may be analogized to the three stages of an injunction The filing of the petition which gives rise to the automatic stay is similar to a temporary restraining order The preliminary hearing is similar to the hearing on a preliminary injunction and the final hearing and order are similar to the hearing and issuance or denial of a permanent injunction The main difference lies in which party must bring the issue before the court While in the injunction setting the party seeking the injunction must prosecute the action in proceeding for relief from the automatic stay the enjoined party must move The difference does not however shift the burden of proof Subsection g leaves that burden on the party opposing relief from the stay that is on the party seeking continuance of the injunction on the issue of adequate protection and existence of an equity It is not however intended to be confined strictly to the constitutional requirement This section and the concept of adequate protection are based as much on policy grounds as on constitutional grounds Secured creditors should not be deprived of the benefit of their bargain There may be situations in bankruptcy where giving a secured creditor an absolute right to his bargain may be impossible or seriously detrimental to the policy of the bankruptcy laws Thus this section recognizes the availability of alternate means of protecting a secured creditor s interest where such steps are a necessary part of the rehabilitative process Though the creditor might not be able to retain his lien upon the specific collateral held at the time of filing the purpose of the section is to insure that the secured creditor receives the value for which he bargained The section specifies two exclusive means of providing adequate protection both of which may require an approximate determination of the value of the protected entity s interest in the property involved The section does not specify how value is to be determined nor does it specify when it is to be determined These matters are left to case by case interpretation and development In light of the restrictive approach of the section to the availability of means of providing adequate protection this flexibility is important to permit the courts to adapt to varying circumstances and changing modes of financing Neither is it expected that the courts will construe the term value to mean in every case forced sale liquidation value or full going concern value There is wide latitude between those two extremes although forced sale liquidation value will be a minimum In any particular case especially a reorganization case the determination of which entity should be entitled to the difference between the going concern value and the liquidation value must be based on equitable considerations arising from the facts of the case Finally the determination of value is binding only for the purposes of the specific hearing and is not to have a res judicata effect The first method of adequate protection outlined is the making of cash payments to compensate for the expected decrease in value of the opposing entity s interest This provision is derived from In re Bermec Corporation 445 F 2d 367 2d Cir 1971 though in that case it is not clear whether the payments offered were adequate to compensate the secured creditors for their loss The use of periodic payments may be appropriate where for example the property in question is depreciating at a relatively fixed rate The periodic payments would be to compensate for the depreciation and might but need not necessarily be in the same amount as payments due on the secured obligation The second method is the fixing of an additional or replacement lien on other property of the debtor to the extent of the decrease in value or actual consumption of the property involved The purpose of this method is to provide the protected entity with an alternative means of realizing the value of the original property if it should decline during the case by granting an interest in additional property from whose value the entity may realize its loss This is consistent with the view expressed in Wright v Union Central Life Ins Co 311 U S 273 1940 where the Court suggested that it was the value of the secured creditor s collateral and not necessarily his rights in specific collateral that was entitled to protection The section makes no provision for the granting of an administrative priority as a method of providing adequate protection to an entity as was suggested in In re Yale Express System Inc 384 F 2d 990 2d Cir 1967 because such protection is too uncertain to be meaningful house report no 95 – 595 The section specifies four means of providing adequate protection They are neither exclusive nor exhaustive They all rely however on the value of the protected entity s interest in the property involved The section does not specify how value is to be determined nor does it specify when it is to be determined These matters are left to case by case interpretation and development It is expected that the courts will apply the concept in light of facts of each case and general equitable principles It is not intended that the courts will develop a hard and fast rule that will apply in every case The time and method of valuation is not specified precisely in order to avoid that result There are an infinite number of variations possible in dealings between debtors and creditors the law is continually developing and new ideas are continually being implemented in this field The flexibility is important to permit the courts to adapt to varying circumstances and changing modes of financing Neither is it expected that the courts will construe the term value to mean in every case forced sale liquidation value or full going concern value There is wide latitude between those two extremes In any particular case especially a reorganization case the determination of which entity should be entitled to the difference between the going concern value and the liquidation value must be based on equitable considerations based on the facts of the case It will frequently be based on negotiation between the parties Only if they cannot agree will the court become involved The first method of adequate protection specified is periodic cash payments by the estate to the extent of a decrease in value of the opposing entity s interest in the property involved This provision is derived from In re Yale Express Inc 384 F 2d 990 2d Cir 1967 though in that case it is not clear whether the payments required were adequate to compensate the secured creditors for their loss The use of periodic payments may be appropriate where for example the property in question is depreciating at a relatively fixed rate The periodic payments would be to compensate for the depreciation The second method is the provision of an additional or replacement lien on other property to the extent of the decrease in value of the property involved The purpose of this method is to provide the protected entity with a means of realizing the value of the original property if it should decline during the case by granting an interest in additional property from whose value the entity may realize its loss The third method is the granting of an administrative expense priority to the protected entity to the extent of his loss This method more than the others requires a prediction as to whether the unencumbered assets that will remain if the case if converted from reorganization to liquidation will be sufficient to pay the protected entity in full It is clearly the most risky from the entity s perspective and should be used only when there is relative certainty that administrative expenses will be able to be paid in full in the event of liquidation The fourth [ enacted as third ] method gives the parties and the courts flexibility by allowing such other relief as will result in the realization by the protected entity of the value of its interest in the property involved Under this provision the courts will be able to adapt to new methods of financing and to formulate protection that is appropriate to the circumstances of the case if none of the other methods would accomplish the desired result For example another form of adequate protection might be the guarantee by a third party outside the judicial process of compensation for any loss incurred in the case Adequate protection might also in some circumstances be provided by permitting a secured creditor to bid in his claim at the sale of the property and to offset the claim against the price bid in The paragraph also defines more clearly than the others the general concept of adequate protection by requiring such relief as will result in the realization of value It is the general category and as such is defined by the concept involved rather than any particular method of adequate protection Amendments 1984 — Par 1 Pub L 98 – 353 inserted a cash payment or after make Effective Date of 1984 Amendment Amendment by Pub L 98 –

In any hearing under subsection d or e of this section concerning relief from the stay of any act under subsection a of this section — 1 the party requesting such relief has the burden of proof on the issue of the debtor s equity in property and 2 the party opposing such relief has the burden of proof on all other issues h 1 In a case in which the debtor is an individual the stay provided by subsection a is terminated with respect to personal property of the estate or of the debtor securing in whole or in part a claim or subject to an unexpired lease and such personal property shall no longer be property of the estate if the debtor fails within the applicable time set by section 521 a 2 — A to file timely any statement of intention required under section 521 a 2 with respect to such

or benefit to the estate and orders appropriate adequate protection of the creditor s interest and orders the debtor to deliver any collateral in the debtor s possession to the trustee If the court does not so determine the stay provided by subsection a shall terminate upon the conclusion of the hearing on the motion i If a case commenced under chapter 7 11 or 13 is dismissed due to the creation of a debt repayment plan for purposes of subsection c 3 any subsequent case commenced by the debtor under any such chapter shall not be presumed to be filed not in good faith j On request of a party

the provision contained in the Senate amendment enjoining the commencement or continuation of a judicial administrative or other proceeding to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case The provision is beneficial and interacts with section 362 a 6 which also covers assessment to prevent harassment of the debtor with respect to pre petition claims Section 362 a 7 contains a provision contained in H R 8200 as passed by the House The differing provision in the Senate amendment was rejected It is not possible that a debt owing to the debtor may be offset against an interest in the debtor Section 362 a 8 is new The provision stays the commencement or continuation of any proceeding concerning the debtor before the U S Tax Court Section 362 b 4 indicates that the stay under section 362 a 1 does not apply to affect the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce the governmental unit s police or regulatory power This section is intended to be given a narrow construction in order to permit governmental units to pursue actions to protect the public health and safety and not to apply to actions by a governmental unit to protect a pecuniary interest in property of the debtor or property of the estate Section 362 b 6 of the House amendment adopts a provision contained in the Senate amendment restricting the exception to the automatic stay with respect to setoffs to permit only the setoff of mutual debts and claims Traditionally the right of setoff has been limited to mutual debts and claims and the lack of the clarifying term mutual in H R 8200 as passed by the House created an unintentional ambiguity Section 362 b 7 of the House amendment permits the issuance of a notice of tax deficiency The House amendment rejects section 362 b 7 in the Senate amendment It would have permitted a particular governmental unit to obtain a pecuniary advantage without a hearing on the merits contrary to the exceptions contained in sections 362 b 4 and 5 Section 362 d of the House amendment represents a compromise between comparable provisions in the House bill and Senate amendment Under section 362 d 1 of the House amendment the court may terminate annul modify or condition the automatic stay for cause including lack of adequate protection of an interest in property of a secured party It is anticipated that the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure will provide that those hearings will receive priority on the calendar Under section 362 d 2 the court may alternatively terminate annul modify or condition the automatic stay for cause including inadequate protection for the creditor The court shall grant relief from the stay if there is no equity and it is not necessary to an effective reorganization of the debtor The latter requirement is contained in section 362 d 2 This section is intended to solve the problem of real property mortgage foreclosures of property where the bankruptcy petition is filed on the eve of foreclosure The section is not intended to apply if the business of the debtor is managing or leasing real property such as a hotel operation even though the debtor has no equity if the property is necessary to an effective reorganization of the debtor Similarly if the debtor does have an equity in the property there is no requirement that the property be sold under section 363 of title 11 as would have been required by the Senate amendment Section 362 e of the House amendment represents a modification of provisions in H R 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate amendment to make clear that a final hearing must be commenced within 30 days after a preliminary hearing is held to determine whether a creditor will be entitled to relief from the automatic stay In order to insure that those hearings will in fact occur within such 30 day period it is anticipated that the rules of bankruptcy procedure provide that such final hearings receive priority on the court calendar Section 362 g places the burden of proof on the issue of the debtor s equity in collateral on the party requesting relief from the automatic stay and the burden on other issues on the debtor An amendment has been made to section 362 b to permit the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to commence an action to foreclose a mortgage or deed of trust The commencement of such an action is necessary for tax purposes The section is not intended to permit the continuation of such an action after it is commenced nor is the section to be construed to entitle the Secretary to take possession in lieu of foreclosure Automatic stay Sections 362 b 8 and 9 contained in the Senate amendment are largely deleted in the House amendment Those provisions add to the list of actions not stayed a jeopardy assessments b other assessments and c the issuance of deficiency notices In the House amendment jeopardy assessments against property which ceases to be property of the estate is already authorized by section 362 c 1 Other assessments are specifically stayed under section 362 a 6 while the issuance of a deficiency notice is specifically permitted Stay of the assessment and the permission to issue a statutory notice of a tax deficiency will permit the debtor to take his personal tax case to the Tax Court if the bankruptcy judge authorizes him to do so as explained more fully in the discussion of section 505 senate report no 95 – 989 The automatic stay is one of the fundamental debtor protections provided by the bankruptcy laws It gives the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors It stops all collection efforts all harassment and all foreclosure actions It permits the debtor to attempt a repayment or reorganization plan or simply to be relieved of the financial pressures that drove him into bankruptcy The action commenced by the party seeking relief from the stay is referred to as a motion to make it clear that at the expedited hearing under subsection e and at hearings on relief from the stay the only issue will be the lack of adequate protection the debtor s equity in the property and the necessity of the property to an effective reorganization of the debtor or the existence of other cause for relief from the stay This hearing will not be the appropriate time at which to bring in other issues such as counterclaims against the creditor which although relevant to the question of the amount of the debt concern largely collateral or unrelated matters This approach is consistent with that taken in cases such as In re Essex Properties Ltd 430 F Supp 1112 N D Cal 1977 that an action seeking relief from the stay is not the assertion of a claim which would give rise to the right or obligation to assert counterclaims Those counterclaims are not to be handled in the summary fashion that the preliminary hearing under this provision will be Rather they will be the subject of more complete proceedings by the trustee to recover property of the estate or to object to the allowance of a claim However this would not preclude the party seeking continuance of the stay from presenting evidence on the existence of claims which the court may consider in exercising its discretion What is precluded is a determination of such collateral claims on the merits at the hearing house report no 95 – 595 Paragraph 7 [ of subsec a ] stays setoffs of mutual debts and credits between the debtor and creditors As with all other paragraphs of subsection a this paragraph does not affect the right of creditors It simply stays its enforcement pending an orderly examination of the debtor s and creditors rights Subsection c governs automatic termination of the stay Subsections d through g govern termination of the stay by the court on the request of a party in interest Subsection d requires the court on request of a party in interest to grant relief from the stay such as by terminating annulling modifying or conditioning the stay for cause The lack of adequate protection of an interest in property of the party requesting relief from the stay is one cause for relief but is not the only cause As noted above a desire to permit an action to proceed to completion in another tribunal may provide another cause Other causes might include the lack of any connection with or interference with the pending bankruptcy case For example a divorce or child custody proceeding involving the debtor may bear no relation to the bankruptcy case In that case it should not be stayed A probate proceeding in which the debtor is the executor or administrator of another s estate usually will not be related to the bankruptcy case and should not be stayed Generally proceedings in which the debtor is a fiduciary or involving postpetition activities of the debtor need not be stayed because they bear no relationship to the purpose of the automatic stay which is debtor protection from his creditors The facts of each request will determine whether relief is appropriate under the circumstances Subsection e provides a protection for secured creditors that is not available under present law The subsection sets a time certain within which the bankruptcy court must rule on the adequacy of protection provided of the secured creditor s interest If the court does not rule within 30 days from a request for relief from the stay the stay is automatically terminated with respect to the property in question In order to accommodate more complex cases the subsection permits the court to make a preliminary ruling after a preliminary hearing After a preliminary hearing the court may continue the stay only if there is a reasonable likelihood that the party opposing relief from the stay will prevail at the final hearing Because the stay is essentially an injunction the three stages of the stay may be analogized to the three stages of an injunction The filing of the petition which gives rise to the automatic stay is similar to a temporary restraining order The preliminary hearing is similar to the hearing on a preliminary injunction and the final hearing and order is similar to a permanent injunction The main difference lies in which party must bring the issue before the court While in the injunction setting the party seeking the injunction must prosecute the action in proceedings for relief from the automatic stay the enjoined party must move The difference does not however shift the burden of proof Subsection g leaves that burden on the party opposing relief from the stay that is on the party seeking continuance of the injunction on the issue of adequate protection At the expedited hearing under subsection e and at all hearings on relief from the stay the only issue will be the claim of the creditor and the lack of adequate protection or existence of other cause for relief from the stay This hearing will not be the appropriate time at which to bring in other issues such as counterclaims against the creditor on largely unrelated matters Those counterclaims are not to be handled in the summary fashion that the preliminary hearing under this provision will be Rather they will be the subject of more complete proceedings by the trustees to recover property of the estate or to object to the allowance of a claim References in Text Section 5 a 3 of the

defines cash collateral as defined in the Senate amendment The broader definition of soft collateral contained in H R 8200 as passed by the House is deleted to remove limitations that were placed on the use lease or sale of inventory accounts contract rights general intangibles and chattel paper by the trustee or debtor in possession Section 363 c 2 of the House amendment is derived from the Senate amendment Similarly sections 363 c 3 and 4 are derived from comparable provisions in the Senate amendment in lieu of the contrary procedure contained in section 363 c as passed by the House The policy of the House amendment will generally require the court to schedule a preliminary hearing in accordance with the needs of the debtor to authorize the trustee or debtor in possession to use sell or lease cash collateral The trustee or debtor in possession may use sell or lease cash collateral in the ordinary course of business only after notice and a hearing Section 363 f of the House amendment adopts an identical provision contained in the House bill as opposed to an alternative provision contained in the Senate amendment Section 363 h of the House amendment adopts a new paragraph 4 representing a compromise between the House bill and Senate amendment The provision adds a limitation indicating that a trustee or debtor in possession sell jointly owned property only if the property is not used in the production transmission or distribution for sale of electric energy or of natural or synthetic gas for heat light or power This limitation is intended to protect public utilities from being deprived of power sources because of the bankruptcy of a joint owner Section 363 k of the House amendment is derived from the third sentence of section 363 e of the Senate amendment The provision indicates that a secured creditor may bid in the full amount of the creditor s allowed claim including the secured portion and any unsecured portion thereof in the event the creditor is undersecured with respect to property that is subject to a lien that secures the allowed claim of the sale of the property senate report no 95 – 989 This section defines the right and powers of the trustee with respect to the use sale or lease of property and the rights of other parties that have interests in the property involved It applies in both liquidation and reorganization cases Subsection a defines cash collateral as cash negotiable instruments documents of title securities deposit accounts or other cash equivalents in which the estate and an entity other than the estate have an interest such as a lien or a co ownership interest The definition is not restricted to property of the estate that is cash collateral on the date of the filing of the petition Thus if non cash collateral is disposed of and the proceeds come within the definition of cash collateral as set forth in this subsection the proceeds would be cash collateral as long as they remain subject to the original lien on the non cash collateral under section 552 b To illustrate rents received from real property before or after the commencement of the case would be cash collateral to the extent that they are subject to a lien Subsection b permits the trustees to use sell or lease other than in the ordinary course of business property of the estate upon notice and opportunity for objections and hearing thereon Subsection c governs use sale or lease in the ordinary course of business If the business of the debtor is authorized to be operated under § 721 1108 or 1304 of the bankruptcy code then the trustee may use sell or lease property in the ordinary course of business or enter into ordinary course transactions without need for notice and hearing This power is subject to several limitations First the court may restrict the trustee s powers in the order authorizing operation of the business Second with respect to cash collateral the trustee may not use sell or lease cash collateral except upon court authorization after notice and a hearing or with the consent of each entity that has an interest in such cash collateral The same preliminary hearing procedure in the automatic stay section applies to a hearing under this subsection In addition the trustee is required to segregate and account for any cash collateral in the trustee s possession custody or control Under subsections d and e the use sale or lease of property is further limited by the concept of adequate protection Sale use or lease of property in which an entity other than the estate has an interest may be effected only to the extent not inconsistent with any relief from the stay granted to that interest s holder Moreover the court may prohibit or condition the use sale or lease as is necessary to provide adequate protection of that interest Again the trustee has the burden of proof on the issue of adequate protection Subsection e also provides that where a sale of the property is proposed an entity that has an interest in such property may bid at the sale thereof and set off against the purchase price up to the amount of such entity s claim No prior valuation under section 506 a would limit this bidding right since the bid at the sale would be determinative of value Subsection f permits sale of property free and clear of any interest in the property of an entity other than the estate The trustee may sell free and clear if applicable nonbankruptcy law permits it if the other entity consents if the interest is a lien and the sale price of the property is greater than the amount secured by the lien if the interest is in bona fide dispute or if the other entity could be compelled to accept a money satisfaction of the interest in a legal or equitable proceeding Sale under this subsection is subject to the adequate protection requirement Most often adequate protection in connection with a sale free and clear of other interests will be to have those interests attach to the proceeds of the sale At a sale free and clear of other interests any holder of any interest in the property being sold will be permitted to bid If that holder is the high bidder he will be permitted to offset the value of his interest against the purchase price of the property Thus in the most common situation a holder of a lien on property being sold may bid at the sale and if successful may offset the amount owed to him that is secured by the lien on the property but may not offset other amounts owed to him against the purchase price and be liable to the trustee for the balance of the sale price if any Subsection g permits the trustee to sell free and clear of any vested or contingent right in the nature of dower or curtesy Subsection h permits sale of a co owner s interest in property in which the debtor had an undivided ownership interest such as a joint tenancy a tenancy in common or a tenancy by the entirety Such a sale is permissible only if partition is impracticable if sale of the estate s interest would realize significantly less for the estate that sale of the property free of the interests of the co owners and if the benefit to the estate of such a sale outweighs any detriment to the co owners This subsection does not apply to a co owner s interest in a public utility when a disruption of the utilities services could result Subsection i provides protections for co owners and spouses with dower curtesy or community property rights It gives a right of first refusal to the co owner or spouse at the price at which the sale is to be consummated Subsection j requires the trustee to distribute to the spouse or co owner the appropriate portion of the proceeds of the sale less certain administrative expenses Subsection k [ enacted as l ] permits the trustee to use sell or lease property notwithstanding certain bankruptcy or ipso facto clauses that terminate the debtor s interest in the property or that work a forfeiture or modification of that interest This subsection is not as broad as the anti ipso facto provision in proposed 11 U S C 541 c 1 Subsection l [ enacted as m ] protects good faith purchasers of property sold under this section from a reversal on appeal of the sale authorization unless the authorization for the sale and the sale itself were stayed pending appeal The purchaser s knowledge of the appeal is irrelevant to the issue of good faith Subsection m [ enacted as n ] is directed at collusive bidding on property sold under this section It permits the trustee to void a sale if the price of the sale was controlled by an agreement among potential bidders The trustees may also recover the excess of the value of the property over the purchase price and may recover any costs attorney s fees or expenses incurred in voiding the sale or recovering the difference In addition the court is authorized to grant judgment in favor of the estate and against the collusive bidder if the agreement controlling the sale price was entered into in willful disregard of this subsection The subsection does not specify the precise measure of damages but simply provides for punitive damages to be fixed

right against the estate or the debtor on account of any damage occurring after such date caused by such nonperformance C The rejection of a lease of real property in a shopping center with respect to which the lessee elects to retain its rights under subparagraph A ii does not affect the enforceability under applicable nonbankruptcy law of any provision in the lease pertaining to radius location use exclusivity or tenant mix or balance D In this paragraph lessee includes any successor assign or mortgagee permitted under the terms of such lease 2 A If the trustee rejects a timeshare interest under a timeshare plan under which the debtor is the timeshare interest seller and — i if the rejection amounts to such a breach as would entitle the timeshare interest purchaser to treat the timeshare plan as terminated under its terms applicable nonbankruptcy law or any agreement made by timeshare interest purchaser the timeshare interest purchaser under the timeshare plan may treat the timeshare plan as terminated by such rejection or ii if the term of such timeshare interest has commenced then the timeshare interest purchaser may retain its rights in such timeshare interest for the

rejection of such timeshare interest and the term of any renewal or extension of such timeshare interest the value of any damage caused by the nonperformance after the date of such rejection of any obligation of the debtor under such timeshare plan but the timeshare interest purchaser shall not have any right against the estate or the debtor on account of any damage occurring after such date caused by such nonperformance i 1 If the trustee rejects an executory contract of the debtor for the sale of real property or for the sale of a timeshare interest under a timeshare plan under which the purchaser is in possession such purchaser may treat such contract as terminated or in the alternative may remain in possession of such real property or timeshare interest 2 If such purchaser remains in possession — A such purchaser shall continue to make all payments due under such contract but may offset against such payments any damages occurring after the date of the rejection of such contract caused by the nonperformance of any obligation of the debtor after such date but such purchaser does not have any rights against the estate on account of any damages arising after such date

of this section 365 and sections 541 b 2 and 362 b 10 leases of real property shall include any rental agreement to use real property n 1 If the trustee rejects an executory contract under which the debtor is a licensor of a right to intellectual property the licensee under such contract may elect — A to treat such contract as terminated by such rejection if such rejection by the trustee amounts to such a breach as would entitle the licensee to treat such contract as terminated by virtue of its own terms applicable nonbankruptcy law or an agreement made by the licensee with another entity or B to retain its rights including a right to enforce any exclusivity provision of such contract but excluding any other right under applicable nonbankruptcy law to specific performance of such contract under such contract and under any agreement supplementary to such contract to such intellectual property including any embodiment of such intellectual property to the extent protected by applicable nonbankruptcy law as such rights existed immediately before the case commenced for — i the duration of such contract and ii any period for which such contract may be extended by the licensee as of right under applicable nonbankruptcy law 2 If the licensee elects to retain its rights as described in paragraph 1 B of this subsection under such contract — A the trustee shall allow the licensee to exercise such rights B the licensee shall make all royalty payments due under such contract for the duration of such contract and for any period described in paragraph 1 B of this subsection for which

including such embodiment held by the trustee and B not interfere with the rights of the licensee as provided in such contract or any agreement supplementary to such contract to such intellectual property including such embodiment including any right to obtain such intellectual property or such embodiment from another entity 4 Unless and until the trustee rejects such contract on the written request of the licensee the trustee shall — A to the extent provided in such contract or any agreement supplementary to such contract — i perform such contract or ii provide to the licensee such intellectual property including any embodiment of such intellectual property to the extent protected by applicable nonbankruptcy law held by the trustee and B not interfere with the rights of the licensee as provided in such contract or any agreement supplementary to such contract to such intellectual property including such embodiment including any right to obtain such intellectual property or such embodiment from another entity o In a case under chapter 11 of this title the trustee shall be deemed to have assumed consistent with the debtor s other obligations under section 507 and shall immediately cure any deficit under any commitment by the debtor to a Federal depository institutions regulatory agency or predecessor to such agency to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution and any claim for a subsequent breach of the obligations thereunder shall be entitled to priority under section 507 This subsection shall not extend any commitment that would otherwise be terminated by any act of such an agency p 1 If a lease of personal property is rejected or not timely assumed by the trustee under subsection d the leased property is no longer property of the estate and the stay under section 362 a is automatically terminated 2 A If the debtor in a case under chapter 7 is an individual the debtor may notify the creditor in writing that the debtor desires to assume the lease Upon being so notified the creditor may at its option notify the debtor that it is willing to have the lease assumed by the debtor and may condition such assumption on cure of any outstanding default on terms set by the contract B If not later than 30 days after notice is provided under subparagraph A the debtor notifies the lessor in writing that the lease is assumed the liability under the lease will be assumed by the debtor and not by the estate C The stay under section 362 and the injunction under section 524 a 2 shall not be violated by notification of the debtor and negotiation of cure under this subsection 3 In a case under chapter 11 in which the debtor is an individual and in a case under chapter 13 if the debtor is the lessee with respect to personal property and the lease is not assumed in the plan confirmed by the court the lease is deemed rejected as of the conclusion of the hearing on confirmation If the lease is rejected the stay under

H R 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate amendment The provision adopts standards contained in section 365 b 5 of the Senate amendment to define adequate assurance of future performance of a lease of real property in a shopping center Section 365 b 4 of the House amendment indicates that after default the trustee may not require a lessor to supply services or materials without assumption unless the lessor is compensated as provided in the lease Section 365 c 2 and 3 likewise represent a compromise between H R 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate amendment Section 365 c 2 is derived from section 365 b 4 of the Senate amendment but does not apply to a contract to deliver equipment as provided in the Senate amendment As contained in the House amendment the provision prohibits a trustee or debtor in possession from assuming or assigning an executory contract of the debtor to make a loan or extend other debt financing or financial accommodations to or for the benefit of the debtor or the issuance of a security of the debtor Section 365 e is a refinement of comparable provisions contained in the House bill and Senate amendment Sections 365 e 1 and 2 A restate section 365 e of H R 8200 as passed by the House Sections 365 e 2 B expands the section to permit termination of an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor if such contract is a contract to make a loan or extend other debt financing or financial accommodations to or for the benefit of the debtor or for the issuance of a security of the debtor Characterization of contracts to make a loan or extend other debt financing or financial accommodations is limited to the extension of cash or a line of credit and is not intended to embrace ordinary leases or contracts to provide goods or services with payments to be made over time Section 365 f is derived from H R 8200 as passed by the House Deletion of language in section 365 f 3 of the Senate amendment is done as a matter of style Restrictions with respect to assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease are superfluous since the debtor may assign an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor only if such contract is first assumed under section 364 f 2 A of the House amendment Section 363 h of the House amendment represents a modification of section 365 h of the Senate amendment The House amendment makes clear that in the case of a bankrupt lessor a lessee may remain in possession for the balance of the term of a lease and any renewal or extension of the term only to the extent that such renewal or extension may be obtained by the lessee without the permission of the landlord or some third party under applicable non bankruptcy law senate report no 95 – 989 Subsection a of this section authorizes the trustee subject to the court s approval to assume or reject an executory contract or unexpired lease Though there is no precise definition of what contracts are executory it generally includes contracts on which performance remains due to some extent on both sides A note is not usually an executory contract if the only performance that remains is repayment Performance on one side of the contract would have been completed and the contract is no longer executory Because of the volatile nature of the commodities markets and the special provisions governing commodity broker liquidations in subchapter IV of chapter 7 the provisions governing distribution in section 765 a will govern if any conflict between those provisions and the provisions of this section arise Subsections b c and d provide limitations on the trustee s powers Subsection b requires the trustee to cure any default in the contract or lease and to provide adequate assurance of future performance if there has been a default before he may assume This provision does not apply to defaults under ipso facto or bankruptcy clauses which is a significant departure from present law Subsection b 3 permits termination of leases entered into prior to the effective date of this title in liquidation cases if certain other conditions are met Subsection b 4 [ enacted as c 2 ] prohibits the trustee s assumption of an executory contract requiring the other party to make a loan or deliver equipment to or to issue a security of the debtor The purpose of this subsection is to make it clear that a party to a transaction which is based upon the financial strength of a debtor should not be required to extend new credit to the debtor whether in the form of loans lease financing or the purchase or discount of notes Subsection b 5 provides that in lease situations common to shopping centers protections must be provided for the lessor if the trustee assumes the lease including protection against decline in percentage rents breach of agreements with other tenants and preservation of the tenant mix Protection for tenant mix will not be required in the office building situation Subsection c prohibits the trustee from assuming or assigning a contract or lease if applicable nonbankruptcy law excuses the other party from performance to someone other than the debtor unless the other party consents This prohibition applies only in the situation in which applicable law excuses the other party from performance independent of any restrictive language in the contract or lease itself Subsection d places time limits on assumption and rejection In a liquidation case the trustee must assume within 60 days or within an additional 60 days if the court for cause extends the time If not assumed the contract or lease is deemed rejected In a rehabilitation case the time limit is not fixed in the bill However if the other party to the contract or lease requests the court to fix a time the court may specify a time within which the trustee must act This provision will prevent parties in contractual or lease relationships with the debtor from being left in doubt concerning their status vis a vis the estate Subsection e invalidates ipso facto or bankruptcy clauses These clauses protected under present law automatically terminate the contract or lease or permit the other contracting party to terminate the contract or lease in the event of bankruptcy This frequently hampers rehabilitation efforts If the trustee may assume or assign the contract under the limitations imposed by the remainder of the section the contract or lease may be utilized to assist in the debtor s rehabilitation or liquidation The unenforcibility [ sic ] of ipso facto or bankruptcy clauses proposed under this section will require the courts to be sensitive to the rights of the nondebtor party to executory contracts and unexpired leases If the trustee is to assume a contract or lease the court will have to insure that the trustee s performance under the contract or lease gives the other contracting party the full benefit of his bargain This subsection does not limit the application of an ipso facto or bankruptcy clause if a new insolvency or receivership occurs after the bankruptcy case is closed That is the clause is not invalidated in toto but merely made inapplicable during the case for the purposes of disposition of the executory contract or unexpired lease Subsection f partially invalidates restrictions on assignment of contracts or leases by the trustee to a third party The subsection imposes two restrictions on the trustee he must first assume the contract or lease subject to all the restrictions on assumption found in the section and adequate assurance of future performance must be provided to the other contracting party Paragraph 3 of the subsection invalidates contractual provisions that permit termination or modification in the event of an assignment as contrary to the policy of this subsection Subsection g defines the time as of which a rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease constitutes a breach of the contract or lease Generally the breach is as of the date immediately preceding the date of the petition The purpose is to treat rejection claims as prepetition claims The remainder of the subsection specifies different times for cases that are converted from one chapter to another The provisions of this subsection are not a substantive authorization to breach or reject an assumed contract Rather they prescribe the rules for the allowance of claims in case an assumed contract is breached or if a case under chapter 11 in which a contract has been assumed is converted to a case under chapter 7 in which the contract is rejected Subsection h protects real property lessees of the debtor if the trustee rejects an unexpired lease under which the debtor is the lessor or sublessor The subsection permits the lessee to remain in possession of the leased property or to treat the lease as terminated by the rejection The balance of the term of the lease referred to in paragraph 1 will include any renewal terms that are enforceable by the tenant but not renewal terms if the landlord had an option to terminate Thus the tenant will not be deprived of his estate for the term for which he bargained If the lessee remains in possession he may offset the rent reserved under the lease against damages caused by the rejection but does not have any affirmative rights against the estate for any damages after the rejection that result from the rejection Subsection i gives a purchaser of real property under a land installment sales contract similar protection The purchaser if the contract is rejected may remain in possession or may treat the contract as terminated If the purchaser remains in possession he is required to continue to make the payments due but may offset damages that occur after rejection The trustee is required to deliver title but is relieved of all other obligations to perform A purchaser that treats the contract as terminated is granted a lien on the property to the extent of the purchase price paid A party with a contract to purchase land from the debtor has a lien on the property to secure the price already paid if the contract is rejected and the purchaser is not yet in possession Subsection k relieves the trustee and the estate of liability for a breach of an assigned contract or lease that occurs after the assignment house report no 95 – 595 Subsection c prohibits the trustee from assuming or assigning a contract or lease if applicable nonbankruptcy law excuses the other party from performance to someone other than the debtor unless the other party consents This prohibition applies only in the situation in which applicable law excuses the other party from performance independent of any restrictive language in the contract or lease itself The purpose of this subsection at least in part is to prevent the trustee from requiring new advances of money or other property The section permits the trustee to continue to use and pay for property already advanced but is not designed to permit the trustee to demand new loans or additional transfers of property under lease commitments Thus under this provision contracts such as loan commitments and letters of credit are nonassignable and may not be assumed by the trustee Subsection e invalidates ipso facto or bankruptcy clauses These clauses protected under present law automatically terminate the contract or lease or permit the other contracting party to terminate the contract or lease in the event of bankruptcy This frequently hampers rehabilitation efforts If the trustee may assume or assign the contract under the limitations imposed by the remainder of the section then the contract or lease may be utilized to assist in the debtor s rehabilitation or liquidation The unenforceability of ipso facto or bankruptcy clauses proposed under this section will require the courts to be sensitive to the rights of the nondebtor party to executory contracts and unexpired leases If the trustee is to assume a contract or lease the courts will have to insure that the trustee s performance under the contract or lease gives the other contracting party the full benefit of his bargain An example of the complexity that may arise in these situations and the need for a determination of all aspects of a particular executory contract or unexpired lease is the shopping center lease under which the debtor is a tenant in a shopping center A shopping center is often a carefully planned enterprise and though it consists of numerous individual tenants the center is planned as a single unit often subject to a master lease or financing agreement Under these agreements the tenant mix in a shopping center may be as important to the lessor as the actual promised rental payments because certain mixes will attract higher patronage of the stores in the center and thus a higher rental for the landlord from those stores that are subject to a percentage of gross receipts rental agreement Thus in order to assure a landlord of his bargained for exchange the court would have to consider such factors as the nature of the business to be conducted by the trustee or his assignee whether that business complies with the requirements of any master agreement whether the kind of business proposed will generate gross sales in an amount such that the percentage rent specified in the lease is substantially the same as what would have been provided by the debtor and whether the business proposed to be conducted would result in a breach of other clauses in master agreements relating for example to tenant mix and location This subsection does not limit the application of an ipso facto or bankruptcy clause to a new insolvency or receivership after the bankruptcy case is closed That is the clause is not invalidated in toto but merely made inapplicable during the case for the purpose of disposition of the executory contract or unexpired lease Amendments 2005 — Subsec b 1 A Pub L
