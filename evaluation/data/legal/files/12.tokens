An arraignment must be conducted in open court and must consist of 1 ensuring that the defendant has a copy of the indictment or information 2 reading the indictment or information to the defendant or stating to the defendant the substance of the charge and then 3 asking the defendant to plead to the indictment or information b A defendant need not be present for the arraignment if 1 the defendant has been charged by indictment or misdemeanor information 2 the defendant in a written waiver signed by both the defendant and defense counsel has waived appearance and has affirmed that the defendant received a copy of the indictment or information and that the plea is not guilty and 3 the court accepts the waiver c Video Teleconferencing Video teleconferencing may be used to arraign a defendant if the defendant consents As amended Mar 9 1987 eff Aug 1 1987 Apr 29 2002 eff Dec 1 2002 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1944 1 The first sentence states the prevailing practice 2 The requirement that the defendant shall be given a copy of the indictment or information before he is called upon to plead contained in the second sentence is new 3 Failure to comply with arraignment requirements has been held not to be jurisdictional but a mere technical irregularity not warranting a reversal of a conviction if not raised before trial Garland v State of Washington 232 U S 642 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment The amendments are technical No substantive change is intended Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 10 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only except as noted below Read together Rules 10 and 43 require the defendant to be physically present in court for the arraignment See e g Valenzuela Gonzales v United States 915 F 2d 1276 1280 9th Cir 1990 Rules 10 and 43 are broader in protection than the Constitution The amendments to Rule 10 create two exceptions to that requirement The first provides that the court may hold an arraignment in the defendant s absence when the defendant has waived the right to be present in writing and the court consents to that waiver The second permits the court to hold arraignments by video teleconferencing when the defendant is at a different location A conforming amendment has also been made to Rule 43 In amending Rule 10 and Rule 43 the Committee was concerned that permitting a defendant to be absent from the arraignment could be viewed as an erosion of an important element of the judicial process First it may be important for a defendant to see and experience first hand the formal impact of the reading of the charge Second it may be necessary for the court to personally see and speak with the defendant at the arraignment especially when there is a real question whether the defendant actually understands the gravity of the proceedings And third there may be difficulties in providing the defendant with effective and confidential assistance of counsel if counsel but not the defendant appears at the arraignment The Committee nonetheless believed that in appropriate circumstances the court and the defendant should have the option of conducting the arraignment in the defendant s absence The question of when it would be appropriate for a defendant to waive an appearance is not spelled out in the rule That is left to the defendant and the court in each case A critical element to the amendment is that no matter how convenient or cost effective a defendant s absence might be the defendant s right to be present in court stands unless he or she waives that right in writing Under the amendment both the defendant and the defendant s attorney must sign the waiver Further the amendment requires that the waiver specifically state that the defendant has received a copy of the charging instrument If the trial court has reason to believe that in a particular case the defendant should not be permitted to waive the right the court may reject the waiver and require that the defendant actually appear in court That might be particularly appropriate when the court wishes to discuss substantive or procedural matters in conjunction with the arraignment and the court believes that the defendant s presence is important in resolving those matters It might also be appropriate to reject a requested waiver where an attorney for the government presents reasons for requiring the defendant to appear personally The amendment does not permit waiver of an appearance when the defendant is charged with a felony information In that instance the defendant is required by Rule 7 b to be present in court to waive the indictment Nor does the amendment permit a waiver of appearance when the defendant is standing mute see Rule 11 a 4 or entering a conditional plea see Rule 11 a 2 a nolo contendere plea see Rule 11 a 3 or a guilty plea see Rule 11 a 1 In each of those instances the Committee believed that it was more appropriate for the defendant to appear personally before the court It is important to note that the amendment does not permit the defendant to waive the arraignment itself which may be a triggering mechanism for other rules Rule 10 c addresses the second substantive change in the rule That provision permits the court to conduct arraignments through video teleconferencing if the defendant waives the right to be arraigned in court Although the practice is now used in state courts and in some federal courts Rules 10 and 43 have generally prevented federal courts from using that method for arraignments in criminal cases See e g Valenzuela Gonzales v United States supra Rules 10 and 43 mandate physical presence of defendant at arraignment and that arraignment take place in open court A similar amendment was proposed by the Committee in 1993 and published for public comment The amendment was later withdrawn from consideration in order to consider the results of several planned pilot programs Upon further consideration the Committee believed that the benefits of using video teleconferencing outweighed the costs of doing so This amendment also parallels an amendment in Rule 5 f that would permit initial appearances to be conducted by video teleconferencing In amending Rules 5 10 and 43 which generally requires the defendant s presence at all proceedings the Committee carefully considered the argument that permitting a defendant to appear by video teleconferencing might be considered an erosion of an important element of the judicial process Much can be lost when video teleconferencing occurs First the setting itself may not promote the public s confidence in the integrity and solemnity of a federal criminal proceeding that is the view of some who have witnessed the use of such proceedings in some state jurisdictions While it is difficult to quantify the intangible benefits and impact of requiring a defendant to be brought before a federal judicial officer in a federal courtroom the Committee realizes that something is lost when a defendant is not required to make a personal appearance A related consideration is that the defendant may be located in a room that bears no resemblance whatsoever to a judicial forum and the equipment may be inadequate for high quality transmissions Second using video teleconferencing can interfere with counsel s ability to meet personally with his or her client at what at least in that jurisdiction might be an important appearance before a magistrate judge Third the defendant may miss an opportunity to meet with family or friends and others who might be able to assist the defendant especially in any attempts to obtain bail Finally the magistrate judge may miss an opportunity to accurately assess the physical emotional and mental condition of a defendant — a factor that may weigh on pretrial decisions such as release from detention On the other hand the Committee considered that in some jurisdictions the courts face a high volume of criminal proceedings The Committee was also persuaded to adopt the amendment because in some jurisdictions delays may occur in travel time from one location to another — in some cases requiring either the magistrate judge or the participants to travel long distances In those instances it is not unusual for a defense counsel to recognize the benefit of conducting a video teleconferenced proceeding which will eliminate lengthy and sometimes expensive travel or permit the arraignment to be conducted much sooner Finally the Committee was aware that in some jurisdictions courtrooms now contain high quality technology for conducting such procedures and that some courts are already using video teleconferencing — with the consent of the parties The Committee believed that on balance and in appropriate circumstances the court and the defendant should have the option of using video teleconferencing for arraignments as long as the defendant consents to that procedure The question of when it would be appropriate for a defendant to consent is not spelled out in the rule That is left to the defendant and the court in each case Although the rule does not specify any particular technical requirements regarding the system to be used if the equipment or technology is deficient the public may lose confidence in the integrity and dignity of the proceedings The amendment does not require a court to adopt or use video teleconferencing In deciding whether to use such procedures a court may wish to consider establishing clearly articulated standards and procedures For example the court would normally want to insure that the location used for televising the video teleconferencing is conducive to the solemnity of a federal criminal proceeding That might require additional coordination for example with the detention facility to insure that the room furniture and furnishings reflect the dignity associated with a federal courtroom Provision should also be made to insure that the judge or a surrogate is in a position to carefully assess the condition of the defendant And the court should also consider establishing procedures for insuring that counsel and the defendant and even the defendant s immediate family are provided an ample opportunity to confer in private Although the rule requires the defendant to waive a personal appearance for an arraignment the rule does not require that the waiver for video teleconferencing be in writing Nor does it require that the defendant waive that appearance in person in open court It would normally be sufficient for the defendant to waive an appearance while participating through a video teleconference The amendment leaves to the courts the decision first whether to permit video arraignments and second the procedures to be used The Committee was satisfied that the technology has progressed to the point that video teleconferencing can address the concerns raised in the past about the ability of the court and the defendant to see each other and for the defendant and counsel to be in contact with each other either at the same location or by a secure remote connection Rule 11 Pleas a Entering a Plea 1 In General A defendant may plead not guilty guilty or with the court s consent nolo contendere 2 Conditional Plea With the consent of the court and the government a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere reserving in writing the right to have an appellate court review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial motion A defendant who prevails on appeal may then withdraw the plea 3 Nolo Contendere Plea Before accepting a plea of nolo contendere the court must consider the parties views and the public interest in the effective administration of justice 4 Failure to Enter a Plea If a defendant refuses to enter a plea or if a defendant organization fails to appear the court must enter a plea of not guilty b Considering and Accepting a Guilty or Nolo Contendere Plea 1 Advising and Questioning the Defendant Before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere the defendant may be placed under oath and the court must address the defendant personally in open court During this address the court must inform the defendant of and determine that the defendant understands the following A the government s right in a prosecution for perjury or false statement to use against the defendant any statement that the defendant gives under oath B the right to plead not guilty or having already so pleaded to persist in that plea C the right to a jury trial D the right to be represented by counsel — and if necessary have the court appoint counsel — at trial and at every other stage of the proceeding E the right at trial to confront and cross examine adverse witnesses to be protected from compelled self incrimination to testify and present evidence and to compel the attendance of witnesses F the defendant s waiver of these trial rights if the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere G the nature of each charge to which the defendant is pleading H any maximum possible penalty including imprisonment fine and term of supervised release I any mandatory minimum penalty J any applicable forfeiture K the court s authority to order restitution L the court s obligation to impose a special assessment M in determining a sentence the court s obligation to calculate the applicable sentencing guideline range and to consider that range possible departures under the Sentencing Guidelines and other sentencing factors under 18 U S C § 3553 a N the terms of any plea agreement provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally attack the sentence and O that if convicted a defendant who is not a United States citizen may be removed from the United States denied citizenship and denied admission to the United States in the future 2 Ensuring That a Plea Is Voluntary Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere the court must address the defendant personally in open court and determine that the plea is voluntary and did not result from force threats or promises other than promises in a plea agreement 3 Determining the Factual Basis for a Plea Before entering judgment on a guilty plea the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea c Plea Agreement Procedure 1 In General An attorney for the government and the defendant s attorney or the defendant when proceeding pro se may discuss and reach a plea agreement The court must not participate in these discussions If the defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to either a charged offense or a lesser or related offense the plea agreement may specify that an attorney for the government will A not bring or will move to dismiss other charges B recommend or agree not to oppose the defendant s request that a particular sentence or sentencing range is appropriate or that a particular provision of the Sentencing Guidelines or policy statement or sentencing factor does or does not apply such a recommendation or request does not bind the court or C agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case or that a particular provision of the Sentencing Guidelines or policy statement or sentencing factor does or does not apply such a recommendation or request binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement 2 Disclosing a Plea Agreement The parties must disclose the plea agreement in open court when the plea is offered unless the court for good cause allows the parties to disclose the plea agreement in camera 3 Judicial Consideration of a Plea Agreement A To the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11 c 1 A or C the court may accept the agreement reject it or defer a decision until the court has reviewed the presentence report B To the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11 c 1 B the court must advise the defendant that the defendant has no right to withdraw the plea if the court does not follow the recommendation or request 4 Accepting a Plea Agreement If the court accepts the plea agreement it must inform the defendant that to the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11 c 1 A or C the agreed disposition will be included in the judgment 5 Rejecting a Plea Agreement If the court rejects a plea agreement containing provisions of the type specified in Rule 11 c 1 A or C the court must do the following on the record and in open court or for good cause in camera A inform the parties that the court rejects the plea agreement B advise the defendant personally that the court is not required to follow the plea agreement and give the defendant an opportunity to withdraw the plea and C advise the defendant personally that if the plea is not withdrawn the court may dispose of the case less favorably toward the defendant than the plea agreement contemplated d Withdrawing a Guilty or Nolo Contendere Plea A defendant may withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere 1 before the court accepts the plea for any reason or no reason or 2 after the court accepts the plea but before it imposes sentence if A the court rejects a plea agreement under Rule 11 c 5 or B the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal e Finality of a Guilty or Nolo Contendere Plea After the court imposes sentence the defendant may not withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere and the plea may be set aside only on direct appeal or collateral attack f Admissibility or Inadmissibility of a Plea Plea Discussions and Related Statements The admissibility or inadmissibility of a plea a plea discussion and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 410 g Recording the Proceedings The proceedings during which the defendant enters a plea must be recorded by a court reporter or by a suitable recording device If there is a guilty plea or a nolo contendere plea the record must include the inquiries and advice to the defendant required under Rule 11 b and c h Harmless Error A variance from the requirements of this rule is harmless error if it

] While at times criticized as theoretically lacking in logical basis experience has shown that it performs a useful function from a practical standpoint Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1966 Amendment The great majority of all defendants against whom indictments or informations are filed in the federal courts plead guilty Only a comparatively small number go to trial See United States Attorneys Statistical Report Fiscal Year 1964 p 1 The fairness and adequacy of the procedures on acceptance of pleas of guilty are of vital importance in according equal justice to all in the federal courts Three changes are made in the second sentence The first change makes it clear that before accepting either a plea of guilty or nolo contendere the court must determine that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge The second change expressly requires the court to address the defendant personally in the course of determining that the plea is made voluntarily and with understanding of the nature of the charge The reported cases reflect some confusion over this matter Compare United States v Diggs 304 F 2d 929 6th Cir 1962 Domenica v United States 292 F 2d 483 1st Cir 1961 Gundlach v United States 262 F 2d 72 4th Cir 1958 cert den 360 U S 904 1959 and Julian v United States 236 F 2d 155 6th Cir 1956 which contain the implication that

Cir 1963 Smith v United States 324 F 2d 436 D C Cir 1963 but cf Marvel v United States 335 F 2d 101 5th Cir 1964 A new sentence is added at the end of the rule to impose a duty on the court in cases where the defendant pleads guilty to satisfy itself that there is a factual basis for the plea before entering judgment The court should satisfy itself by inquiry of the defendant or the attorney for the government or by examining the presentence report or otherwise that the conduct which the defendant admits constitutes the offense charged in the indictment or information or an offense included therein to which the defendant has pleaded guilty Such inquiry should e g protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge For a similar requirement see Mich Stat Ann § 28 1058 1954 Mich Sup Ct Rule 35A In re Valle 364 Mich 471 110 N W 2d 673 1961 People v Barrows 358 Mich 267 99 N W 2d 347 1959 People v Bumpus 355 Mich 374 94 N W 2d 854 1959 People v Coates 337 Mich 56 59 N W 2d 83 1953 See also Stinson v United States 316 F 2d 554 5th Cir 1963 The normal consequence of a determination that there is not a factual basis for the plea would be for the court to set aside the plea and enter a plea of not guilty For a variety of reasons it is desirable in some cases to permit entry of judgment upon a plea of nolo contendere without inquiry into the factual basis for the plea The new third sentence is not therefore made applicable to pleas of nolo contendere It is not intended by this omission to reflect any view upon the effect of a plea of nolo contendere in relation to a plea of guilty That problem has been dealt with by the courts See e g Lott v United States 367 U S 421 426 1961 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1974 Amendment The amendments to rule 11 are designed to achieve two principal objectives 1 Subdivision c prescribes the advice which the court must give to insure that the defendant who pleads guilty has made an informed plea 2 Subdivision e provides a plea agreement procedure designed to give recognition to the propriety of plea discussions to bring the existence of a plea agreement out into the open in court and to provide methods for court acceptance or rejection of a plea agreement Other less basic changes are also made The changes are discussed in the order in which they appear in the rule Subdivision b retains the requirement that the defendant obtain the consent of the court in order to plead nolo contendere It adds that the court shall in deciding whether to accept the plea consider the views of the prosecution and of the defense and also the larger public interest in the administration of criminal justice Although the plea of nolo contendere has long existed in the federal courts Hudson v United States 272 U S 451 47 S Ct 127 71 L Ed 347 1926 the desirability of the plea has been a subject of disagreement Compare Lane Reticker Nolo Contendere in North Carolina 34 N C L Rev 280 290 – 291 1956 with Note The Nature and Consequences of the Plea of Nolo Contendere 33 Neb L Rev 428 434 1954 favoring the plea The American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice takes the position that the case for the nolo plea is not strong enough to justify a minimum standard supporting its use but because use of the plea contributes in some degree to the avoidance of unnecessary trials it does not proscribe use of the plea ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty § 1 1 a Commentary at 16 Approved Draft 1968 A plea of nolo contendere is for purposes of punishment the same as the plea of guilty See discussion of the history of the nolo plea in North

factors considered relevant by particular courts in determining whether to permit the plea of nolo contendere vary Compare United States v Bagliore 182 F Supp 714 716 E D N Y 1960 where the view is taken that the plea should be rejected unless a compelling reason for acceptance is established with United States v Jones 119 F Supp 288 290 S D Cal 1954 where the view is taken that the plea should be accepted in the absence of a compelling reason to the contrary A defendant who desires to plead nolo contendere will commonly want to avoid pleading guilty because the plea of guilty can be introduced as an admission in subsequent civil litigation The prosecution may oppose the plea of nolo contendere because it wants a definite resolution of the defendant s guilty or innocence either for correctional purposes or for reasons of subsequent litigation ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty § 1 1 b Commentary at 16 – 18 Approved Draft 1968 Under subdivision b of the new rule the balancing of the interests is left to the trial judge who is mandated to take into account the larger public interest in the effective administration of justice Subdivision c prescribes the advice which the court must give to the defendant as a prerequisite to the acceptance of a plea of guilty The former rule required that the court determine that the plea was made with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea The amendment identifies more specifically what must be explained to the defendant and also codifies in the rule the requirements of Boykin v Alabama 395 U S 238 89 S Ct 1709 23 L Ed 2d 274 1969 which held that a defendant must be apprised of the fact that he relinquishes certain constitutional rights by pleading guilty Subdivision c retains the requirement that the court address the defendant personally See McCarthy v United States 394 U S 459 466 89 S Ct 1166 22 L Ed 2d 418 1969 There is also an amendment to rule 43 to make clear that a defendant must be in court at the time of the plea Subdivision c 1 retains the current requirement that the court determine that the defendant understands the nature of the charge This is a common requirement See ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty § 1 4 a Approved Draft 1968 Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402 a 1 1970 Ill Rev Stat 1973 ch 110A § 402 a 1 The method by which the defendant s understanding of the nature of the charge is determined may vary from case to case depending on the complexity of the circumstances and the particular defendant In some cases a judge may do this by reading the indictment and by explaining the elements of the offense to the defendants Thompson The Judge s Responsibility on a Plea of Guilty 62 W Va L Rev 213 220 1960 Resolution of Judges of U S District Court for D C June 24 1959 Former rule 11 required the court to inform the defendant of the consequences of the plea Subdivision c 2 changes this and requires instead that the court inform the defendant of and determine that he understands the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law if any and the maximum possible penalty provided by law for the offense to which the plea is offered The objective is to insure that a defendant knows what minimum sentence the judge must impose and what maximum sentence the judge may impose This information is usually readily ascertainable from the face of the statute defining the crime and thus it is feasible for the judge to know specifically what to tell the defendant Giving this advice tells a defendant the shortest mandatory sentence and also the longest possible sentence for the offense to which he is pleading guilty It has been suggested that it is desirable to inform a defendant of additional consequences which might follow from his plea of guilty Durant v United States 410 F 2d 689 1st Cir 1969 held that a defendant must be informed of his ineligibility for parole Trujillo v United States 377 F 2d 266 5th Cir 1967 cert denied 389 U S 899 88 S Ct 224 19 L Ed 2d 221 1967 held that advice about eligibility for parole is not required It has been suggested that a defendant be advised that a jury might find him guilty only of a lesser included offense C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure Criminal § 173 at 374 1969 See contra Dorrough v United States 385 F 2d 887 5th Cir 1967 The ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty § 1 4 c iii Approved Draft 1968 recommend that the defendant be informed that he may be subject to additional punishment if the offense charged is one for which a different or additional punishment is authorized by reason of the defendant s previous conviction Under the rule the judge is not required to inform a defendant about these matters though a judge is free to do so if he feels a consequence of a plea of guilty in a particular case is likely to be of real significance to the defendant Currently certain consequences of a plea of guilty such as parole eligibility may be so complicated that it is not feasible to expect a judge to clearly advise the defendant For example the judge may impose a sentence under 18 U S C § 4202 making the defendant eligible for parole when he has served one third of the judicially imposed maximum or under 18 U S C § 4208 a 1 making parole eligibility after a specified period of time less than one third of the maximum or under 18 U S C § 4208 a 2 leaving eligibility to the discretion of the parole board At the time the judge is required to advise the defendant of the consequences of his plea the judge will usually not have seen the presentence report and thus will have no basis for giving a defendant any very realistic advice as to when he might be eligible for parole Similar complications exist with regard to other particularly collateral consequences of a plea of guilty in a given case Subdivisions c 3 and 4 specify the constitutional rights that the defendant waives by a plea of guilty or nolo contendere These subdivisions are designed to satisfy the requirements of understanding waiver set forth in Boykin v Alabama 395 U S 238 89 S Ct 1709 23 L Ed 2d 274 1969 Subdivision c 3 is intended to require that the judge inform the defendant and determine that he understands that he waives his fifth amendment rights The rule takes the position that the defendant s right not to incriminate himself is best explained in terms of his right to plead not guilty and to persist in that plea if it has already been made This is language identical to that adopted in Illinois for the same purpose See Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402 a 3 1970 Ill Rev Stat 1973 ch 110A § 402 a 3 Subdivision c 4 assumes that a defendant s right to have his guilt proved beyond a reasonable doubt and the right to confront his accusers are best explained by indicating that the right to trial is waived Specifying that there will be no future trial of any kind makes this fact clear to those defendants who though knowing they have waived trial by jury are under the mistaken impression that some kind of trial will follow Illinois has recently adopted similar language Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402 a 4 1970 Ill Rev Stat 1973 ch 110A § 402 a 4 In explaining to a defendant that he waives his right to trial the judge may want to explain some of the aspects of trial such as the right to confront witnesses to subpoena witnesses to testify in his own behalf or if he chooses not to testify What is required in this respect to conform to Boykin is left to future case law development Subdivision d retains the requirement that the court determine that a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is voluntary before accepting it It adds the requirement that the court also inquire whether the defendant s willingness to plead guilty or nolo contendere results from prior plea discussions between the attorney for the government and the defendant or his attorney See Santobello v New York 404 U S 257 261 – 262 92 S Ct 495 30 L Ed 2d 427 1971 The plea must of course be voluntary and knowing and if it was induced by promises the essence of those promises must in some way be made known Subdivisions d and e afford the court adequate basis for rejecting an improper plea agreement induced by threats or inappropriate promises The new rule specifies that the court personally address the defendant in determining the voluntariness of the plea By personally interrogating the defendant not only will the judge be better able to ascertain the plea s voluntariness but he will also develop a more complete record to support his determination in a subsequent post conviction attack * * * Both of these goals are undermined in proportion to the degree the district judge resorts to assumptions not based upon recorded responses to his inquiries McCarthy v United States 394 U S 459 466 467 89 S Ct 1166 22 L Ed 2d 418 1969 Subdivision e provides a plea agreement procedure In doing so it gives recognition to the propriety of plea discussions and plea agreements provided that they are disclosed in open court and subject to acceptance or rejection by the trial judge Although reliable statistical information is limited one recent estimate indicated that guilty pleas account for the disposition of as many as 95 % of all criminal cases ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty pp 1 – 2 Approved Draft 1968 A

not necessarily validate those pleas or the system which produces them But we cannot hold that it is unconstitutional for the State to extend a benefit to a defendant who in turn extends a substantial benefit to the State and who demonstrates by his plea that he is ready and willing to admit his crime and to enter the correctional system in a frame of mind that affords hope for success in rehabilitation over a shorter period of time than might otherwise be necessary In Santobello v New York 404 U S 257 260 92 S Ct 495 498 30 L Ed 2d 427 1971 the court said The disposition of criminal charges by agreement between the prosecutor and the accused sometimes loosely called plea bargaining is an essential component of the administration of justice Properly administered it is to be

Courts 9 – 13 The procedure described in subdivision e is designed to prevent abuse of plea discussions and agreements by providing appropriate and adequate safeguards Subdivision e 1 specifies that the attorney for the government and the attorney for the defendant or the defendant when acting pro se may participate in plea discussions The inclusion of the defendant when acting pro se is intended to reflect the fact that there are situations in which a defendant insists upon representing himself It may be desirable that an attorney for the government not enter plea discussions with a defendant personally If necessary counsel can be appointed for purposes of plea discussions Subdivision d makes it mandatory that the court inquire of the defendant whether his plea is the result of plea discussions between him and the attorney for the government This is intended to enable the court to reject an agreement reached by an unrepresented defendant unless the court is satisfied that acceptance of the agreement adequately protects the rights of the defendant and the interests of justice This is substantially the position of the ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty § 3 1 a

the attorneys for the government and the defense may agree that a given sentence is an appropriate disposition of the case This is made explicit in subdivision e 2 where reference is made to an

rule does not speak directly to the issue of whether a judge may accept a plea of guilty where there is a factual basis for the plea but the defendant asserts his innocence North Carolina v Alford 400 U S 25 91 S Ct 160 27 L Ed 2d 162 1970 The procedure in such case would seem to be to deal with this as a plea of nolo contendere the acceptance of which would depend upon the judge s decision as to whether acceptance of the plea is consistent with the interest of the public in the effective administration of justice [ new rule 11 b ] The defendant who asserts his innocence while pleading guilty or nolo contendere is often difficult to deal with in a correctional setting and it may therefore be preferable to resolve the issue of guilt or innocence at the trial stage rather than leaving that issue unresolved thus complicating subsequent correctional decisions The rule is intended to make clear that a judge may reject a plea of nolo contendere and require the defendant either to plead not guilty or to plead guilty under circumstances in which the judge is able to determine that the defendant is in fact guilty of the crime to which he is pleading guilty Subdivision g requires that a verbatim record be kept of the proceedings If there is a plea of guilty or nolo contendere the record must include without limitation the court s advice to the defendant the inquiry into the

Guilty § 1 7 Approved Draft 1968 A similar requirement was adopted in Illinois Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402 e 1970 Ill Rev Stat 1973 ch 110A § 402 e Notes of Committee on the Judiciary House Report No 94 – 247 1975 Amendment A Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deals with pleas The Supreme Court has proposed to amend this rule extensively Rule 11 provides that a defendant may plead guilty not guilty or nolo contendere The Supreme Court s amendments to Rule 11 b provide that a nolo contendere plea shall be accepted by the court only after due consideration of the views of the parties and the interest of the public in the effective administration of justice The Supreme Court amendments to Rule 11 c spell out the advise that the court must give to the defendant before accepting the defendant s plea of guilty or nolo contendere The Supreme Court amendments to Rule 11 d set forth the steps that the court must take to insure that a guilty or nolo contendere plea has been voluntarily made The Supreme Court amendments to Rule 11 e establish a plea agreement procedure This procedure permits the parties to discuss disposing of a case without a trial and sets forth the type of agreements that the parties can reach concerning the disposition of the case The procedure is not mandatory a court is free not to permit the parties to present plea agreements to it The Supreme Court amendments to Rule 11 f require that the court before entering judgment upon a plea of guilty satisfy itself that there is a factual basis for the plea The Supreme Court amendments to Rule 11 g require that a verbatim record be kept of the proceedings at which the defendant enters a plea B Committee Action The proposed amendments to Rule 11 particularly those relating to the plea negotiating procedure have generated much comment and criticism No observer is entirely happy that our criminal justice system must rely to the extent it does on negotiated dispositions of cases However crowded court dockets make plea negotiating a fact that the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should contend with The Committee accepts the basic structure and provisions of Rule 11 e Rule 11 e as proposed permits each federal court to decide for itself the extent to which it will permit plea negotiations to be carried on within its own jurisdiction No court is compelled to permit any plea negotiations at all Proposed Rule 11 e regulates plea negotiations and agreements if and to the extent that the court permits such negotiations and agreements [ Proposed Rule 11 e has been criticized by some federal judges who read it to mandate the court to permit plea negotiations and the reaching of plea agreements The Advisory Committee stressed during its testimony that the rule does not mandate that a court permit any form of plea agreement to be presented to it See e g the remarks of United States Circuit Judge William H Webster in Hearings II at 196 See also the exchange of correspondence between Judge Webster and United States District Judge Frank A Kaufman in Hearings II at 289 – 90 ] Proposed Rule 11 e contemplates 4 different types of plea agreements First the defendant can plead guilty or nolo contendere in return for the prosecutor s reducing the charge to a less serious offense Second the defendant can plead guilty or nolo contendere in return for the prosecutor dropping or not bringing a charge or charges relating to other offenses Third the defendant can plead guilty or nolo contendere in return for the prosecutor s recommending a sentence Fourth the defendant and prosecutor can agree that a particular sentence is the appropriate disposition of the case [ It is apparent though not explicitly stated that Rule 11 e contemplates that the plea agreement may bind the defendant to do more than just plead guilty or nolo contendere For example the plea agreement may bind the defendant to cooperate with the prosecution in a different investigation The Committee intends by its approval of Rule 11 e to permit the parties to agree on such terms in a plea agreement ] The Committee added language in subdivisions e 2 and e 4 to permit a plea agreement to be disclosed to the court or rejected by it in camera There must be a showing of good cause before the court can conduct such proceedings in camera The language does not address itself to whether the showing of good cause may be made in open court or in camera That issue is left for the courts to resolve on a case by case basis These changes in subdivisions e 2 and e 4 will permit a fair trial when there is substantial media interest in a case and the court is rejecting a plea agreement The Committee added an exception to subdivision e 6 That subdivision provides Evidence of a plea of guilty later withdrawn or a plea of nolo contendere or of an offer to plead guilty or nolo contendere to the crime charged or any other crime or of statements made in connection with any of the foregoing pleas or offers is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding against the person who made the plea or offer The Committee s exception permits the use of such evidence in a perjury or false statement prosecution where the plea offer or related statement was made by the defendant on the record under oath and in the presence of counsel The Committee recognizes that even this limited exception may discourage defendants from being completely candid and open during plea negotiations and may even result in discouraging the reaching of plea agreements However the Committee believes hat on balance it is more important to protect the integrity of the judicial process from willful deceit and untruthfulness [ The Committee does not intend its language to be construed as mandating or encouraging the swearing in of the defendant during proceedings in connection with the disclosure and acceptance or rejection of a plea agreement ] The Committee recast the language of Rule 11 c which deals with the advice given to a defendant before the court can accept his plea of guilty or nolo contendere The Committee acted in part because it believed that the warnings given to the defendant ought to include those that Boykin v Alabama 395 U S 238 1969 said were constitutionally required In addition and as a result of its change in subdivision e 6 the Committee thought if only fair that the defendant be warned that his plea of guilty later withdrawn or nolo contendere or his offer of either plea or his statements made in connection with such pleas or offers could later be used against him in a perjury trial if made under oath on the record and in the presence of counsel Notes of Conference Committee House Report No 94 – 414 1975 Amendment Note to subdivision c Rule 11 c enumerates certain things that a judge must tell a defendant before the judge can accept that defendant s plea of guilty or nolo contendere The House version expands upon the list originally proposed by the Supreme Court The Senate version adopts the Supreme Court s proposal The Conference adopts the House provision Note to subdivision e 1 Rule 11 e 1 outlines some general considerations concerning the plea agreement procedure The Senate version makes nonsubstantive change in the House version The Conference adopts the Senate provision Note to subdivision e 6 Rule 11 e 6 deals with the use of statements made in connection with plea agreements The House version permits a limited use of pleas of guilty later withdrawn or nolo contendere offers of such pleas and statements made in connection with such pleas or offers Such evidence can be used in a perjury or false statement prosecution if the plea offer or related statement was made under oath on the record and in the presence of counsel The Senate version permits evidence of voluntary and reliable statements made in court on the record to be used for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of the declarant or in a perjury or false statement prosecution The Conference adopts the House version with changes The Conference agrees that neither a plea nor the offer of a plea ought to be admissible for any purpose The Conference adopted provision therefore like the Senate provision permits only the use of statements made in connection with a plea of guilty later withdrawn or a plea of nolo contendere or in connection with an offer of a guilty or nolo contendere plea Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1979 Amendment Note to Subdivision e 2 The amendment to rule 11 e 2 is intended to clarify the circumstances in which the court may accept or reject a plea agreement with the consequences specified in subdivision e 3 and 4 The present language has been the cause of some confusion and has led to results which are not entirely consistent Compare United States v Sarubbi 416 F Supp 633 D N J 1976 with United States v Hull 413 F Supp 145 E D Tenn 1976 Rule 11 e 1 specifies three types of plea agreements namely those in which the attorney for the government might A move for dismissal of other charges or B make a recommendation or agree not to oppose the defendant s request for a particular sentence with the understanding that such recommendation or request shall not be binding upon the court or C agree that a specific sentence is the appropriate disposition of the case A B type of plea agreement is clearly of a different order than the other two for an agreement to recommend or not to oppose is discharged when the prosecutor performs as he agreed to do By comparison critical to a type A or C agreement is that the defendant receive the contemplated charge dismissal or agreed to sentence Consequently there must ultimately be an acceptance or rejection by the court of a type A or C agreement so that it may be determined whether the defendant shall receive the bargained for concessions or shall instead be afforded an opportunity to withdraw his plea But this is not so as to a type B agreement there is no disposition provided for in such a plea agreement so as to make the acceptance provisions of subdivision e 3 applicable nor is there a need for rejection with opportunity for withdrawal under subdivision e 4 in light of the fact that the defendant knew the nonbinding character of the recommendation or request United States v Henderson 565 F 2d 1119 9th Cir 1977 United States v Savage 561 F 2d 554 4th Cir 1977 Because a type B agreement is distinguishable from the others in that it involves only a recommendation or request not binding upon the court it is important that the defendant be aware that this is the nature of the agreement into which he has entered The procedure contemplated by the last sentence of amended subdivision e 2 will establish for the record that there is such awareness This provision conforms to ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty § 1 5 Approved Draft 1968 which provides that the court must advise the defendant personally that the recommendations of the prosecuting attorney are not binding on the court Sometimes a plea agreement will be partially but not entirely of the B type as where a defendant charged with counts 1 2 and 3 enters into an agreement with the attorney for the government wherein it is agreed that if defendant pleads guilty to count 1 the prosecutor will recommend a certain sentence as to that count and will move for dismissal of counts 2 and 3 In such a case the court must take particular care to ensure that the defendant understands which components of the agreement involve only a B type recommendation and which do not In the above illustration that part of the agreement which contemplates the dismissal of counts 2 and 3 is an A type agreement and thus under rule 11 e the court must either accept the agreement to dismiss these counts or else reject it and allow the defendant to withdraw his plea If rejected the defendant must be allowed to withdraw the plea on count 1 even if the type B promise to recommend a certain sentence on that count is kept for a multi faceted plea agreement is nonetheless a single agreement On the other hand if counts 2 and 3 are dismissed and the sentence recommendation is made then the defendant is not entitled to withdraw his plea even if the sentence recommendation is not accepted by the court for the defendant received all he was entitled to under the various components of the plea agreement Note to Subdivision e 6 The major objective of the amendment to rule 11 e 6 is to describe more precisely consistent with the original purpose of the provision what evidence relating to pleas or plea discussions is inadmissible The present language is susceptible to interpretation which would make it applicable to a wide variety of statements made under various circumstances other than within the context of those plea discussions authorized by rule 11 e and intended to be protected by subdivision e 6 of the rule See United States v Herman 544 F 2d 791 5th Cir 1977 discussed herein Fed R Ev 410 as originally adopted by Pub L 93 – 595 provided in part that evidence of a plea of guilty later withdrawn or a plea of nolo contendere or of an offer to plead guilty or nolo contendere to the crime charged or any other crime or of statements made in connection with any of the foregoing pleas or offers is not admissible in any civil or criminal action case or proceeding against the person who made the plea or offer This rule was adopted with the proviso that it shall be superseded by any amendment to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which is inconsistent with this rule As the Advisory Committee Note explained Exclusion of offers to plead guilty or nolo has as its purpose the promotion of disposition of criminal cases by compromise The amendment of Fed R Crim P 11 transmitted to Congress by the Supreme Court in April 1974 contained a subdivision e 6 essentially identical to the rule 410 language quoted above as a part of a substantial revision of rule 11 The most significant feature of this revision was the express recognition given to the fact that the attorney for the government and the attorney for the defendant or the defendant when acting pro se may engage in discussions with a view toward reaching a plea agreement Subdivision e 6 was intended to encourage such discussions As noted in H R Rep No 94 – 247 94th Cong 1st Sess 7 1975 the purpose of subdivision e 6 is to not discourage defendants from being completely candid and open during plea negotiations Similarly H R Rep No 94 – 414 94th Cong 1st Sess 10 1975 states that Rule 11 e 6 deals with the use of statements made in connection with plea agreements Rule 11 e 6 was thereafter enacted with the addition of the proviso allowing use of statements in a prosecution for perjury and with the qualification that the inadmissible statements must also be relevant to the inadmissible pleas or offers Pub L 94 – 64 Fed R Ev 410 was then amended to conform Pub L 94 – 149 While this history shows that the purpose of Fed R Ev 410 and Fed R Crim P 11 e 6 is to permit the unrestrained candor which produces effective plea discussions between the attorney for the government and the attorney for the defendant or the defendant when acting pro se given visibility and sanction in rule 11 e a literal reading of the language of these two rules could reasonably lead to the conclusion that a broader rule of inadmissibility obtains That is because statements are generally inadmissible if made in connection with and relevant to an offer to plead guilty it might be thought that an otherwise voluntary admission to law enforcement officials is rendered inadmissible merely because it was made in the hope of obtaining leniency by a plea Some decisions interpreting rule 11 e 6 point in this direction See United States v Herman 544 F 2d 791 5th Cir 1977 defendant in custody of two postal inspectors during continuance of removal hearing instigated conversation with them and at some point said he would plead guilty to armed robbery if the murder charge was dropped one inspector stated they were not in position to make any deals in this regard held defendant s statement inadmissible under rule 11 e 6 because the defendant made the statements during the course of a conversation in which he sought concessions from the government in return for a guilty plea United States v Brooks 536 F 2d 1137 6th Cir 1976 defendant telephoned postal inspector and offered to plead guilty if he got 2 year maximum statement inadmissible The amendment makes inadmissible statements made in the course of any proceedings under this rule regarding either a plea of guilty later withdrawn or a plea of nolo contendere and also statements made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the government which do not result in a plea of guilty or which result in a plea of guilty later withdrawn It is not limited to statements by the defendant himself and thus would cover statements by defense counsel regarding defendant s incriminating admissions to him It thus fully protects the plea discussion process authorized by rule 11 without attempting to deal with confrontations between suspects and law enforcement agents which involve problems of quite different dimensions See e g ALI Model Code of Pre Arraignment Procedure art 140 and § 150 2 8 Proposed Official Draft 1975 latter section requires exclusion if a law enforcement officer induces any person to make a statement by promising leniency This change it must be emphasized does not compel the conclusion that statements made to law enforcement agents especially when the agents purport to have authority to bargain are inevitably admissible Rather the point is that such cases are not covered by the per se rule of 11 e 6 and thus must be resolved by that body of law dealing with police interrogations If there has been a plea of guilty later withdrawn or a plea of nolo contendere subdivision e 6 C makes inadmissible statements made in the course of any proceedings under this rule regarding such pleas This includes for example admissions by the defendant when he makes his plea in court pursuant to rule 11 and also admissions made to provide the factual basis pursuant to subdivision f However subdivision e 6 C is not limited to statements made in court If the court were to defer its decision on a plea agreement pending examination of the presentence report as authorized by subdivision e 2 statements made to the probation officer in connection with the preparation of that report would come within this provision This amendment is fully consistent with all recent and major law reform efforts on this subject ALI Model Code of Pre Arraignment Procedure § 350 7 Proposed Official Draft 1975 and ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty § 3 4 Approved Draft 1968 both provide Unless the defendant subsequently enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere which is not withdrawn the fact that the defendant or his counsel and the prosecuting attorney engaged in plea discussions or made a plea agreement should not be received in evidence against or in favor of the defendant in any criminal or civil action or administrative proceedings The Commentary to the latter states The above standard is limited to discussions and agreements with the prosecuting attorney Sometimes defendants will indicate to the police their willingness to bargain and in such instances these statements are sometimes admitted in court against the defendant State v Christian 245 S W 2d 895 Mo 1952 If the police initiate this kind of discussion this may have some bearing on the admissibility of the defendant s statement However the policy considerations relevant to this issue are better dealt with in the context of standards governing in custody interrogation by the police Similarly Unif R Crim P 441 d Approved Draft 1974 provides that except under limited circumstances no discussion between the parties or statement by the defendant or his lawyer under this Rule i e the rule providing the parties may meet to discuss the possibility of pretrial diversion * * * or of a plea agreement are admissible The amendment is likewise consistent with the typical state provision on this subject see e g Ill S Ct Rule 402 f The language of the amendment identifies with more precision than the present language the necessary relationship between the statements and the plea or discussion See the dispute between the majority and concurring opinions in United States v Herman 544 F 2d 791 5th Cir 1977 concerning the meanings and effect of the phrases connection to and relevant to in the present rule Moreover by relating the statements to plea discussions rather than an offer to plead the amendment ensures that even an attempt to open plea bargaining [ is ] covered under the same rule of inadmissibility United States v Brooks 536 F 2d 1137 6th Cir 1976 The last sentence of Rule 11 e 6 is amended to provide a second exception to the general rule of nonadmissibility of the described statements Under the amendment such a statement is also admissible in any proceeding wherein another statement made in the course of the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced and the statement ought in fairness be considered contemporaneously with it This change is necessary so that when evidence of statements made in the course of or as a consequence of a certain plea or plea discussions are introduced under circumstances not prohibited by this rule e g not against the person who made the plea other statements relating to the same plea or plea discussions may also be admitted when relevant to the matter at issue For example if a defendant upon a motion to dismiss a prosecution on some ground were able to admit certain statements made in aborted plea discussions in his favor then other relevant statements made in the same plea discussions should be admissible against the defendant in the interest of determining the truth of the matter at issue The language of the amendment follows closely that in Fed R Evid 106 as the considerations involved are very similar The phrase in any civil or criminal proceeding has been moved from its present position following the word against for purposes of clarity An ambiguity presently exists because the word against may be read as referring either to the kind of proceeding in which the evidence is offered or the purpose for which it is offered The change makes it clear that the latter construction is correct No change is intended with respect to provisions making evidence rules inapplicable in certain situations See e g Fed R Evid 104 a and 1101 d Unlike ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty § 3 4 Approved Draft 1968 and ALI Model Code of Pre Arraignment Procedure § 350 7 Proposed Official Draft 1975 rule 11 e 6 does not also provide that the described evidence is inadmissible in favor of the defendant This is not intended to suggest however that such evidence will inevitably be admissible in the defendant s favor Specifically no disapproval is intended of such decisions as United States v Verdoorn 528 F 2d 103 8th Cir 1976 holding that the trial judge properly refused to permit the defendants to put into evidence at their trial the fact the prosecution had attempted to plea bargain with them as meaningful dialogue between the parties would as a practical matter be impossible if either party had to assume the risk that plea offers would be admissible in evidence Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1982 Amendment Note to Subdivision c 1 Subdivision c 1 has been amended by specifying the effect of any special parole term as one of the matters about which a defendant who has tendered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is to be advised by the court This amendment does not make any change in the law as the courts are in agreement that such advice is presently required by Rule 11 See e g Moore v United States 592 F 2d 753 4th Cir 1979 United States v Eaton 579 F 2d 1181 10th Cir 1978 Richardson v United States 577 F 2d 447 8th Cir 1978 United States v Del Prete 567 F 2d 928 9th Cir 1978 United States v Watson 548 F 2d 1058 D C Cir 1977 United States v Crusco 536 F 2d 21 2d Cir 1976 United States v Yazbeck 524 F 2d 641 1st Cir 1975 United States v Wolak 510 F 2d 164 6th Cir 1975 In United States v Timmreck 441 U S 780 1979 99 S Ct 2085 60 L Ed 2d 634 1979 the Supreme Court assumed that the judge s failure in that case to describe the mandatory special parole term constituted a failure to comply with the formal requirements of the Rule The purpose of the amendment is to draw more specific attention to the fact that advice concerning special parole terms is a necessary part of Rule 11 procedure As noted in Moore v United States supra Special parole is a significant penalty * * * Unlike ordinary parole which does not involve supervision beyond the original prison term set by the court and the violation of which cannot lead to confinement beyond that sentence special parole increases the possible period of confinement It entails the possibility that a defendant may have to serve his original sentence plus a substantial additional period without credit for time spent on parole Explanation of special parole in open court is therefore essential to comply with the Rule s mandate that the defendant be informed of the maximum possible penalty provided by law As the aforecited cases indicate in the absence of specification of the requirement in the rule it has sometimes happened that such advice has been inadvertently omitted from Rule 11 warnings The amendment does not attempt to enumerate all of the characteristics of the special parole term which the judge ought to bring to the defendant s attention Some flexibility in this respect must be preserved although it is well to note that the unique characteristics of this kind of parole are such that they may not be readily perceived by laymen Moore v United States supra recommends that in an appropriate case the judge inform the defendant and determine that he understands the following 1 that a special parole term will be added to any prison sentence he receives 2 the minimum length of the special parole term that must be imposed and the absence of a statutory maximum 3 that special parole is entirely different from — and in addition to — ordinary parole and 4 that if the special parole is violated the defendant can be returned to prison for the remainder of his sentence and the full length of his special parole term The amendment should not be read as meaning that a failure to comply with this particular requirement will inevitably entitle the defendant to relief See United States v Timmreck supra Likewise the amendment makes no change in the existing law to the effect that many aspects of traditional parole need not be communicated to the defendant by the trial judge under the umbrella of Rule 11 For example a defendant need not be advised of all conceivable consequences such as when he may be considered for parole or that if he violates his parole he will again be imprisoned Bunker v Wise 550 F 2d 1155 1158 9th Cir 1977 Note to Subdivision c 4 The amendment to subdivision c 4 is intended to overcome the present conflict between the introductory language of subdivision c which contemplates the advice being given [ b ] efore accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere and thus presumably after the plea has been tendered and the if he pleads language of subdivision c 4 which suggests the plea has not been tendered As noted by Judge Doyle in United States v Sinagub 468 F Supp 353 W D Wis 1979 Taken literally this wording of subsection 4 of 11 c suggests that before eliciting any plea at an arraignment the court is required to insure that a defendant understands that if he or she pleads guilty or nolo contendere the defendant will be waiving the right to trial Under subsection 3 of 11 c however there is no requirement that at this pre plea stage the court must insure that the defendant understands that he or she enjoys the right to a trial and at trial the right to the assistance of counsel the right to confront and cross examine witnesses against him or her and the right not to be compelled to incriminate himself or herself It would be incongruous to require that at the pre plea stage the court insure that the defendant understands that if he enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere he will be waiving a right the existence and nature of which need not be explained until after such a plea has been entered I conclude that the insertion of the words that if he pleads guilty or nolo contendere as they appear in subsection 4 of 11 c was an accident of draftsmanship which occurred in the course of Congressional rewriting of 11 c as it has been approved by the Supreme Court Those words are to be construed consistently with the words Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere as they appear in the opening language of 11 c and consistently with the omission of the words that if he pleads from subsections 1 2 and 3 of 11 c That is as they appear in subsection 4 of 11 c the words that if he pleads guilty or nolo contendere should be construed to mean that if his plea of guilty or nolo contendere is accepted by the court Although this is a very logical interpretation of the present language the amendment will avoid the necessity to engage in such analysis in order to determine the true meaning of subdivision c 4 Note to Subdivision c 5 Subdivision c 5 in its present form may easily be read as contemplating that in every case in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is tendered warnings must be given about the possible use of defendant s statements obtained under oath on the record and in the presence of counsel in a later prosecution for perjury or false statement The language has prompted some courts to reach the remarkable result that a defendant who pleads guilty or nolo contendere without receiving those warnings must be allowed to overturn his plea on appeal even though he was never questioned under oath on the record in the presence of counsel about the offense to which he pleaded United States v Artis No 78 – 5012 4th Cir March 12 1979 United States v Boone 543 F 2d 1090 4th Cir 1976 Compare United States v Michaelson 552 F 2d 472 2d Cir 1977 failure to give subdivision c 5 warnings not a basis for reversal at least when as here defendant was not put under oath before questioning about his guilty plea The present language of subdivision c 5 may also have contributed to the conclusion not otherwise supported by the rule that Rule 11 requires that the defendant be under oath for the entirety of the proceedings conducted pursuant to that rule and that failure to place the defendant under oath would itself make necessary overturning the plea on appeal United States v Aldridge 553 F 2d 922 5th Cir 1977 When questioning of the kind described in subdivision c 5 is not contemplated by the judge who is receiving the plea no purpose is served by giving the c 5 warnings which in such circumstances can only confuse the defendant and detract from the force of the other warnings required by Rule 11 As correctly noted in United States v Sinagub supra subsection 5 of section c of Rule 11 is qualitatively distinct from the other sections of the Rule It does not go to whether the plea is knowingly or voluntarily made nor to whether the plea should be accepted and judgment entered Rather it does go to the possible consequences of an event which may or may not occur during the course of the arraignment hearing itself namely the administration of an oath to the defendant Whether this event is to occur is wholly within the control of the presiding judge If the event is not to occur it is pointless to inform the defendant of its consequences If a presiding judge intends that an oath not be administered to a defendant during an arraignment hearing but alters that intention at some point only then would the need arise to inform the defendant of the possible consequences of the administration of the oath The amendment to subdivision c 5 is intended to make it clear that this is the case The amendment limits the circumstances in which the warnings must be given but does not change the fact as noted in Sinagub that these warnings are qualitatively distinct from the other advice required by Rule 11 c This being the case a failure to give the subdivision c 5 warnings even when the defendant was questioned under oath on the record and in the presence of counsel would in no way affect the validity of the defendant s plea Rather this failure bears upon the admissibility of defendant s answers pursuant to subdivision e 6 in a later prosecution for perjury or false statement Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1983 Amendment Note to Subdivision a There are many defenses objections and requests which a defendant must ordinarily raise by pretrial motion See e g 18 U S C § 3162 a 2 Fed R Crim P 12 b Should that motion be denied interlocutory appeal of the ruling by the defendant is seldom permitted See United States v MacDonald 435 U S 850 1978 defendant may not appeal denial of his motion to dismiss based upon Sixth Amendment speedy trial grounds DiBella v United States 369 U S 121 1962 defendant may not appeal denial of pretrial motion to suppress evidence compare Abney v United States 431 U S 651 1977 interlocutory appeal of denial of motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds permissible Moreover should the defendant thereafter plead guilty or nolo contendere this will usually foreclose later appeal with respect to denial of the pretrial motion When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea Tollett v Henderson 411 U S 258 1973 Though a nolo plea differs from a guilty plea in other respects it is clear that it also constitutes a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects in a manner equivalent to a guilty plea Lott v United States 367 U S 421 1961 As a consequence a defendant who has lost one or more pretrial motions will often go through an entire trial simply to preserve the pretrial issues for later appellate review This results in a waste of prosecutorial and judicial resources and causes delay in the trial of other cases contrary to the objectives underlying the Speedy Trial Act of 1974 18 U S C § 3161 et seq These unfortunate consequences may be avoided by the conditional plea device expressly authorized by new subdivision a 2 The development of procedures to avoid the necessity for trials which are undertaken for the sole purpose of preserving pretrial objections has been consistently favored by the commentators See ABA Standards Relating to the Administration of Criminal Justice standard 21 – 1 3 c 2d ed 1978 Model Code of Pre Arraignment Procedure § SS 290 1 4 b 1975 Uniform Rules of Criminal Procedure rule 444 d Approved Draft 1974 1 C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure — Criminal § 175 1969 3 W LaFave Search and Seizure § 11 1 1978 The Supreme Court has characterized the New York practice whereby appeals from suppression motions may be appealed notwithstanding a guilty plea as a commendable effort to relieve the problem of congested trial calendars in a manner that does not diminish the opportunity for the assertion of rights guaranteed by the Constitution Lefkowitz v Newsome 420 U S 283 293 1975 That Court has never discussed conditional pleas as such but has permitted without comment a federal appeal on issues preserved by a conditional plea Jaben v United States 381 U S 214 1965 In the absence of specific authorization by statute or rule for a conditional plea the circuits have divided on the permissibility of the practice Two circuits have actually approved the entry of conditional pleas United States v Burke 517 F 2d 377 2d Cir 1975 United States v Moskow 588 F 2d 882 3d Cir 1978 and two others have praised the conditional plea concept United States v Clark 459 F 2d 977 8th Cir 1972 United States v Dorsey 449 F 2d 1104 D C Cir 1971 Three circuits have expressed the view that a conditional plea is logically inconsistent and thus improper United States v Brown 499 F 2d 829 7th Cir 1974 United States v Sepe 472 F 2d 784 aff d en banc 486 F 2d 1044 5th Cir 1973 United States v Cox 464 F 2d 937 6th Cir 1972 three others have determined only that conditional pleas are not now authorized in the federal system United States v Benson 579 F 2d 508 9th Cir 1978 United States v Nooner 565 F 2d 633 10th Cir 1977 United States v Matthews 472 F 2d 1173 4th Cir 1973 while one circuit has reserved judgment on the issue United States v Warwar 478 F 2d 1183 1st Cir 1973 At the state level a few jurisdictions by statute allow appeal from denial of a motion to suppress notwithstanding a subsequent guilty plea Cal Penal Code § 1538 5 m N Y Crim Proc Law § 710 20 1 Wis Stat Ann § 971 31 10 but in the absence of such a provision the state courts are also in disagreement as to whether a conditional plea is permissible see cases collected in Comment 26 U C L A L Rev 360 373 1978 The conditional plea procedure provided for in subdivision a 2 will as previously noted serve to conserve prosecutorial and judicial resources and advance speedy trial objectives It will also produce much needed uniformity in the federal system on this matter see United States v Clark supra noting the split of authority and urging resolution by statute or rule Also the availability of a conditional plea under specified circumstances will aid in clarifying the fact that traditional unqualified pleas do constitute a waiver of nonjurisdictional defects See United States v Nooner supra defendant sought appellate review of denial of pretrial suppression motion despite his prior unqualified guilty plea claiming the Second Circuit conditional plea practice led him to believe a guilty plea did not bar appeal of pretrial issues The obvious advantages of the conditional plea procedure authorized by subdivision a 2 are not outweighed by any significant or compelling disadvantages As noted in Comment supra at 375 Four major arguments have been raised by courts disapproving of conditioned pleas The objections are that the procedure encourages a flood of appellate litigation militates against achieving finality in the criminal process reduces effectiveness of appellate review due to the lack of a full trial record and forces decision on constitutional questions that could otherwise be avoided by invoking the harmless error doctrine But as concluded therein those arguments do not withstand close analysis Ibid As for the first of those arguments experience in states which have permitted appeals of suppression motions notwithstanding a subsequent plea of guilty is most relevant as conditional pleas are likely to be most common when the objective is to appeal that kind of pretrial ruling That experience has shown that the number of appeals has not increased substantially See Comment 9 Hous L Rev 305 315 – 19 1971 The minimal added burden at the appellate level is certainly a small price to pay for avoiding otherwise unnecessary trials As for the objection that conditional pleas conflict with the government s interest in achieving finality it is likewise without force While it is true that the conditional plea does not have the complete finality of the traditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere because the essence of the agreement is that the legal guilt of the defendant exists only if the prosecution s case survives on appeal the plea continues to serve a partial state interest in finality however by establishing admission of the defendant s factual guilt The defendant stands guilty and the proceedings come to an end if the reserved issue is ultimately decided in the government s favor Comment 26 U C L A L Rev 360 378 1978 The claim that the lack of a full trial record precludes effective appellate review may on occasion be relevant Cf United States v MacDonald supra holding interlocutory appeal not available for denial of defendant s pretrial motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds and noting that most speedy trial claims * * * are best considered only after the relevant facts have been developed at trial However most of the objections which would likely be raised by pretrial motion and preserved for appellate review by a conditional plea are subject to appellate resolution without a trial record Certainly this is true as to the very common motion to suppress evidence as is indicated by the fact that appellate courts presently decide such issues upon interlocutory appeal by the government With respect to the objection that conditional pleas circumvent application of the harmless error doctrine it must be acknowledged that [ a ] bsent a full trial record containing all the government s evidence against the defendant invocation of the harmless error rule is arguably impossible Comment supra at 380 But the harmless error standard with respect to constitutional objections is sufficiently high see Chapman v California 386 U S 18 1967 that relatively few appellate decisions result in affirmance upon that basis Thus it will only rarely be true that the conditional plea device will cause an appellate court to consider constitutional questions which could otherwise have been avoided by invocation of the doctrine of harmless error To the extent that these or related objections would otherwise have some substance they are overcome by the provision in Rule 11 a 2 that the defendant may enter a conditional plea only with the approval of the court and the consent of the government In this respect the rule adopts the practice now found in the Second Circuit The requirement of approval by the court is most appropriate as it ensures for example that the defendant is not allowed to take an appeal on a matter which can only be fully developed by proceeding to trial cf United States v MacDonald supra As for consent by the government it will ensure that conditional pleas will be allowed only when the decision of the court of appeals will dispose of the case either by allowing the plea to stand or by such action as compelling dismissal of the indictment or suppressing essential evidence Absent such circumstances the conditional plea might only serve to postpone the trial and require the government to try the case after substantial delay during which time witnesses may be lost memories dimmed and the offense grown so stale as to lose jury appeal The government is in a unique position to determine whether the matter at issue would be case dispositive and as a party to the litigation should have an absolute right to refuse to consent to potentially prejudicial delay Although it was suggested in United States v Moskow supra that the government should have no right to prevent the entry of a conditional plea because a defendant has no comparable right to block government appeal of a pretrial ruling pursuant to 18 U S C § 3731 that analogy is unconvincing That statute requires the government to certify that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay Moreover where the pretrial ruling is case dispositive § 3731 is the only mechanism by which the government can obtain appellate review but a defendant may always obtain review by pleading not guilty Unlike the state statutes cited earlier Rule 11 a 2 is not limited to instances in which the pretrial ruling the defendant wishes to appeal was in response to defendant s motion to suppress evidence Though it may be true that the conditional plea device will be most commonly employed as to such rulings the objectives of the rule are well served by extending it to other pretrial rulings as well See e g ABA Standards supra declaring the New York provision should be enlarged to include other pretrial defenses Uniform Rules of Criminal Procedure rule 444 d Approved Draft 1974 any pretrial motion which if granted would be dispositive of the case The requirement that the conditional plea be made by the defendant reserving in writing the right to appeal from the adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion though extending beyond the Second Circuit practice will ensure careful attention to any conditional plea It will document that a particular plea was in fact conditional and will identify precisely what pretrial issues have been preserved for appellate review By requiring this added step it will be possible to avoid entry of a conditional plea without the considered acquiescence of the government see United States v Burke supra holding that failure of the government to object to entry of a conditional plea constituted consent and post plea claims by the defendant that his plea should be deemed conditional merely because it occurred after denial of his pretrial motions see United States v Nooner supra It must be emphasized that the only avenue of review of the specified pretrial ruling permitted under a rule 11 a 2 conditional plea is an appeal which must be brought in compliance with Fed R App P 4 b Relief via 28 U S C § 2255 is not available for this purpose The Supreme Court has held that certain kinds of constitutional objections may be raised after a plea of guilty Menna v New York 423 U S 61 1975 double jeopardy violation Blackledge v Perry 417 U S 21 1974 due process violation by charge enhancement following defendant s exercise of right to trial de novo Subdivision 11 a 2 has no application to such situations and should not be interpreted as either broadening or narrowing the Menna Blackledge doctrine or as establishing procedures for its application Note to Subdivision h Subdivision h makes clear that the harmless error rule of Rule 52 a is applicable to Rule 11 The provision does not however attempt to define the meaning of harmless error which is left to the case law Prior to the amendments which took effect on Dec 1 1975 Rule 11 was very brief it consisted of but four sentences The 1975 amendments increased significantly the procedures which must be undertaken when a defendant tenders a plea of guilty or nolo contendere but this change was warranted by the two principal objectives then identified in the Advisory Committee Note 1 ensuring that the defendant has made an informed plea and 2 ensuring that plea agreements are brought out into the open in court An inevitable consequence of the 1975 amendments was some increase in the risk that a trial judge in a particular case might inadvertently deviate to some degree from the procedure which a very literal reading of Rule 11 would appear to require This being so it became more apparent than ever that Rule 11 should not be given such a crabbed interpretation that ceremony was exalted over substance As stated in United States v Scarf 551 F 2d 1124 8th Cir 1977 concerning amended Rule 11 It is a salutary rule and district courts are required to act in substantial compliance with it although * * * ritualistic compliance is not required As similarly pointed out in United States v Saft 558 F 2d 1073 2d Cir 1977 the Rule does note say that compliance can be achieved only by reading the specified items in haec verba Congress meant to strip district judges of freedom to decide what they must explain to a defendant who wishes to plead guilty not to tell them precisely how to perform this important task in the great variety of cases that would come before them While a judge who contents himself with literal application of the Rule will hardly be reversed it cannot be supposed that Congress preferred this to a more meaningful explanation provided that all the specified elements were covered Two important points logically flow from these sound observations One concerns the matter of construing Rule 11 it is not to be read as requiring a litany or other ritual which can be carried out only by word for word adherence to a set script The other specifically addressed in new subdivision h is that even when it may be concluded Rule 11 has not been complied with in all respects it does not inevitably follow that the defendant s plea of guilty or nolo contendere is invalid and subject to being overturned by any remedial device then available to the defendant Notwithstanding the declaration in Rule 52 a that [ a ] ny error defect irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded there has existed for some years considerable disagreement concerning the applicability of the harmless error doctrine to Rule 11 violations In large part this is attributable to uncertainty as to the continued vitality and the reach of McCarthy v United States 394 U S 459 1969 In McCarthy involving a direct appeal from a plea of guilty because of noncompliance with Rule 11 the Court concluded that prejudice inheres in a failure to comply with Rule 11 for noncompliance deprives the defendant of the Rule s procedural safeguards which are designed to facilitate a more accurate determination of the voluntariness of his plea Our holding [ is ] that a defendant whose plea has been accepted in violation of Rule 11 should be afforded the opportunity to plead anew * * * McCarthy has been most frequently relied upon in cases where as in that case the defendant sought relief because of a Rule 11 violation by the avenue of direct appeal It has been held that in such circumstances a defendant s conviction must be reversed whenever the district court accepts his guilty plea without fully adhering to the procedure provided for in Rule 11 United States v Boone 543 F 2d 1090 4th Cir 1976 and that in this context any reliance by the government on the Rule 52 a harmless error concept must be rejected United States v Journet 544 F 2d 633 2d Cir 1976 On the other hand decisions are to be found taking a harmless error approach on direct appeal where it appeared the nature and extent of the deviation from Rule 11 was such that it could not have had any impact on the defendant s decision to plead or the fairness in now holding him to his plea United States v Peters No 77 – 1700 4th Cir Dec 22 1978 where judge failed to comply fully with Rule 11 c 1 in that defendant not correctly advised of maximum years of special parole term but was told it is at least 3 years and defendant thereafter sentenced to 15 years plus 3 year special parole term government s motion for summary affirmance granted as the error was harmless United States v Coronado 554 F 2d 166 5th Cir 1977 court first holds that charge of conspiracy requires some explanation of what conspiracy means to comply with Rule 11 c 1 but then finds no reversible error because the rule 11 proceeding on its face discloses despite the trial court s failure sufficiently to make the required explicitation of the charges that Coronado understood them But this conflict has not been limited to cases involving nothing more than a direct appeal following defendant s plea For example another type of case is that in which the defendant has based a post sentence motion to withdraw his plea on a Rule 11 violation Rule 32 d says that such a motion may be granted to correct manifest injustice and some courts have relied upon this latter provision in holding that post sentence plea withdrawal need not be permitted merely because Rule 11 was not fully complied with and that instead the district court should hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether manifest injustice will result if the conviction based on the guilty plea is permitted to stand United States v Scarf 551 F 2d 1124 8th Cir 1977 Others however have held that McCarthy applies and prevails over the language of Rule 32 d so that a failure to scrupulously comply with Rule 11 will invalidate a plea without a showing of manifest injustice United States v Cantor 469 F 2d 435 3d Cir 1972 Disagreement has also existed in the context of collateral attack upon pleas pursuant to 28 U S C § 2255 On the one hand it has been concluded that [ n ] ot every violation of Rule 11 requires that the plea be set aside in a § 2255 proceeding and that a guilty plea will be set aside on collateral attack only where to not do so would result in a miscarriage of justice or where there exists exceptional circumstances justifying such relief Evers v United States 579 F 2d 71 10th Cir 1978 The contrary view was that McCarthy governed in § 2255 proceedings because the Supreme Court hinted at no exceptions to its policy of strict enforcement of Rule 11 Timmreck v United States 577 F 2d 377 6th Cir 1978 But a unanimous Supreme Court resolved this conflict in United States v Timmreck 441 U S 780 1979 where the Court concluded that the reasoning of Hill v United States 368 U S 424 1962 ruling a collateral attack could not be predicated on a violation of Rule 32 a is equally applicable to a formal violation of Rule 11 * * * Indeed if anything this case may be a stronger one for foreclosing collateral relief than the Hill case For the concern with finality served by the limitation on collateral attack has special force with respect to convictions based on guilty pleas Every inroad on the concept of finality undermines confidence in the integrity of our procedures and by increasing the volume of judicial work inevitably delays and impairs the orderly administration of justice The impact is greatest when new grounds for setting aside guilty pleas are approved because the vast majority of criminal convictions result from such pleas Moreover the concern that unfair procedures may have resulted in the conviction of an innocent defendant is only rarely raised by a petition to set aside a guilty plea This interest in finality is strongest in the collateral attack context the Court was dealing with in Timmreck which explains why the Court there adopted the Hill requirement that in a § 2255 proceeding the rule violation must amount to a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice or an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure The interest in finality of guilty pleas described in Timmreck is of somewhat lesser weight when a direct appeal is involved so that the Hill standard is obviously inappropriate in that setting but yet is sufficiently compelling to make unsound the proposition that reversal is required even where it is apparent that the Rule 11 violation was of the harmless error variety Though the McCarthy per se rule may have been justified at the time and in the circumstances which obtained when the plea in that case was taken this is no longer the case For one thing it is important to recall that McCarthy dealt only with the much simpler pre 1975 version of Rule 11 which required only a brief procedure during which the chances of a minor insignificant and inadvertent deviation were relatively slight This means that the chances of a truly harmless error which was not involved in McCarthy in any event as the judge made no inquiry into the defendant s understanding of the nature of the charge and the government had presented only the extreme argument that a court could properly assume that petitioner was entering that plea with a complete understanding of the charge against him merely from the fact he had stated he desired to plead guilty are much greater under present Rule 11 than under the version before the Court in McCarthy It also means that the more elaborate and lengthy procedures of present Rule 11 again as compared with the version applied in McCarthy make it more apparent than ever that a guilty plea is not a mere gesture a temporary and meaningless formality reversible at the defendant s whim but rather a grave and solemn act which is accepted only with care and discernment United States v Barker 514 F 2d 208 D C Cir 1975 quoting from Brady v United States 397 U S 742 1970 A plea of that character should not be overturned even on direct appeal when there has been a minor and technical violation of Rule 11 which amounts to harmless error Secondly while McCarthy involved a situation in which the defendant s plea of guilty was before the court of appeals on direct appeal the Supreme Court appears to have been primarily concerned with § 2255 type cases for the Court referred exclusively to cases of that kind in the course of concluding that a per se rule was justified as to Rule 11 violations because of the difficulty of achieving [ rule 11 s ] purposes through a post conviction voluntariness hearing But that reasoning has now been substantially undercut by United States v Timmreck supra for the Court there concluded § 2255 relief is not available when all that is shown is a failure to comply with the formal requirements of the Rule at least absent other aggravating circumstances which presumably could often only be developed in the course of a later evidentiary hearing Although all of the aforementioned considerations support the policy expressed in new subdivision h the Advisory Committee does wish to emphasize two important cautionary notes The first is that subdivision h should not be read as supporting extreme or speculative harmless error claims or as in effect nullifying important Rule 11 safeguards There would not be harmless error under subdivision h where for example as in McCarthy there had been absolutely no inquiry by the judge into defendant s understanding of the nature of the charge and the harmless error claim of the government rests upon nothing more than the assertion that it may be assumed defendant possessed such understanding merely because he expressed a desire to plead guilty Likewise it would not be harmless error if the trial judge totally abdicated to the prosecutor the responsibility for giving to the defendant the various Rule 11 warnings as this results in the creation of an atmosphere of subtle coercion that clearly contravenes the policy behind Rule 11 United States v Crook 526 F 2d 708 5th Cir 1976 Indeed it is fair to say that the kinds of Rule 11 violations which might be found to constitute harmless error upon direct appeal are fairly limited as in such instances the matter must be resolved solely on the basis of the Rule 11 transcript and the other portions e g sentencing hearing of the limited record made in such cases United States v Coronado supra Illustrative are where the judge s compliance with subdivision c 1 was not absolutely complete in that some essential element of the crime was not mentioned but the defendant s responses clearly indicate his awareness of that element see United States v Coronado supra where the judge s compliance with subdivision c 2 was erroneous in part in that the judge understated the maximum penalty somewhat but the penalty actually imposed did not exceed that indicated in the warnings see United States v Peters supra and where the judge completely failed to comply with subdivision c 5 which of course has no bearing on the validity of the plea itself cf United States v Sinagub supra The second cautionary note is that subdivision h should not be read as an invitation to trial judges to take a more casual approach to Rule 11 proceedings It is still true as the Supreme Court pointed out in McCarthy that thoughtful and careful compliance with Rule 11 best serves the cause of fair and efficient administration of criminal justice as it will help reduce the great waste of judicial resources required to process the frivolous attacks on guilty plea convictions that are encouraged and are more difficult to dispose of when the original record is inadequate It is therefore not too much to require that before sentencing defendants to years of imprisonment district judges take the few minutes necessary to inform them of their rights and to determine whether they understand the action they are taking Subdivision h makes no change in the responsibilities of the judge at Rule 11 proceedings but instead merely rejects the extreme sanction of automatic reversal It must also be emphasized that a harmless error provision has been added to Rule 11 because some courts have read McCarthy as meaning that the general harmless error provision in Rule 52 a cannot be utilized with respect to Rule 11 proceedings Thus the addition of subdivision h should not be read as suggesting that Rule 52 a does not apply in other circumstances because of the absence of a provision comparable to subdivision h attached to other rules Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1985 Amendment Note to Subdivision c 1 Section 5 of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 Pub L No 97 – 291 96 Stat 1248 1982 adds 18 U S C § 3579 providing that when sentencing a defendant convicted of a Title 18 offense or of violating various subsections of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 the court may order in addition to or in lieu of any other penalty authorized by law that the defendant make restitution to any victim of the offense Under this law restitution is favored if the court does not order restitution or orders only partial restitution the court shall state on the record the reasons therefor Because this restitution is deemed an aspect of the defendant s sentence S Rept No 97 – 532 97th Cong 2d Sess 30 – 33 1982 it is a matter about which a defendant tendering a plea of guilty or nolo contendere should be advised Because this new legislation contemplates that the amount of the restitution to be ordered will be ascertained later in the sentencing process this amendment to Rule 11 c 1 merely requires that the defendant be told of the court s power to order restitution The exact amount or upper limit cannot and need not be stated at the time of the plea Failure of a court to advise a defendant of the possibility of a restitution order would constitute harmless error under subdivision h if no restitution were thereafter ordered Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment The amendments are technical No substantive change is intended Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1989 Amendment The amendment mandates that the district court inform a defendant that the court is required to consider any applicable guidelines but may depart from them under some circumstances This requirement assures that the existence of guidelines will be known to a defendant before a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is accepted Since it will be impracticable if not impossible to know which guidelines will be relevant prior to the formulation of a presentence report and resolution of disputed facts the amendment does not require the court to specify which guidelines will be important or which grounds for departure might prove to be significant The advice that the court is required to give cannot guarantee that a defendant who pleads guilty will not later claim a lack of understanding as to the importance of guidelines at the time of the plea No advice is likely to serve as a complete protection against post plea claims of ignorance or confusion By giving the advice the court places the defendant and defense counsel on notice of the importance that guidelines may play in sentencing and of the possibility of a departure from those guidelines A defendant represented by competent counsel will be in a position to enter an intelligent plea The amended rule does not limit the district court s discretion to engage in a more extended colloquy with the defendant in order to impart additional information about sentencing guidelines or to inquire into the defendant s knowledge concerning guidelines The amended rule sets forth only the minimum advice that must be provided to the defendant by the court Committee Notes on Rules — 1999 Amendment Subdivision a The amendment deletes use of the term corporation and substitutes in its place the term organization with a reference to the definition of that term in 18 U S C § 18 Subdivision c 6 Rule 11 c has been amended specifically to reflect the increasing practice of including provisions in plea agreements which require the defendant to waive certain appellate rights The increased use of such provisions is due in part to the increasing number of direct appeals and collateral reviews challenging sentencing decisions Given the increased use of such provisions the Committee believed it was important to insure that first a complete record exists regarding any waiver provisions and second that the waiver was voluntarily and knowingly made by the defendant Although a number of federal courts have approved the ability of a defendant to enter into such waiver agreements the Committee takes no position on the underlying validity of such waivers Subdivision e Amendments have been made to Rule 11 e 1 B and C to reflect the impact of the Sentencing Guidelines on guilty pleas Although Rule 11 is generally silent on the subject it has become clear that the courts have struggled with the subject of guideline sentencing vis a vis plea agreements entry and timing of guilty pleas and the ability of the defendant to withdraw a plea of guilty The amendments are intended to address two specific issues First both subdivisions e 1 B and e 1 C have been amended to recognize that a plea agreement may specifically address not only what amounts to an appropriate sentence but also a sentencing guideline a sentencing factor or a policy statement accompanying a sentencing guideline or factor Under an e 1 B agreement the government as before simply agrees to make a recommendation to the court or agrees not to oppose a defense request concerning a particular sentence or consideration of a sentencing guideline factor or policy statement The amendment makes it clear that this type of agreement is not binding on the court Second under an e 1 C agreement the government and defense have actually agreed on what amounts to an appropriate sentence or have agreed to one of the specified components The amendment also makes it clear that this agreement is binding on the court once the court accepts it As is the situation under the current Rule the court retains absolute discretion whether to accept a plea agreement GAP Report — Rule 11 The Committee made no changes to the published draft amendments to Rule 11 But it did add language to the Committee Note which reflects the view that the amendment is not intended to signal its approval of the underlying practice of including waiver provisions in pretrial agreements Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 11 has been amended and reorganized as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only except as noted below Amended Rule 11 b 1 requires the court to apprise the defendant of his or her rights before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere The Committee determined to expand upon the incomplete listing in the current rule of the elements of the maximum possible penalty and any mandatory minimum penalty to include advice as to the maximum or minimum term of imprisonment forfeiture fine and special assessment in addition to the two types of maximum and minimum penalties presently enumerated restitution and supervised release The outmoded reference to a term of special parole has been eliminated Amended Rule 11 b 2 formerly Rule 11 d covers the issue of determining that the plea is voluntary and not the result of force threats or promises other than those in a plea agreement The reference to an inquiry in current Rule 11 d whether the plea has resulted from plea discussions with the government has been deleted That reference which was often a source of confusion to defendants who were clearly pleading guilty as part of a plea agreement with the government was considered unnecessary Rule 11 c 1 A includes a change which recognizes a common type of plea agreement — that the government will not bring other charges The Committee considered whether to address the practice in some courts of using judges to facilitate plea agreements The current rule states that the court shall not participate in any discussions between the parties concerning such plea agreement Some courts apparently believe that that language acts as a limitation only upon the judge taking the defendant s plea and thus permits other judges to serve as facilitators for reaching a plea agreement between the government and the defendant See e g United States v Torres 999 F 2d 376 378 9th Cir 1993 noting practice and concluding that presiding judge had not participated in a plea agreement that had resulted from discussions involving another judge The Committee decided to leave the Rule as it is with the understanding that doing so was in no way intended either to approve or disapprove the existing law interpreting that provision Amended Rules 11 c 3 to 5 address the topics of consideration acceptance and rejection of a plea agreement The amendments are not intended to make any change in practice The topics are discussed separately because in the past there has been some question about the possible interplay between the court s consideration of the guilty plea in conjunction with a plea agreement and sentencing and the ability of the defendant to withdraw a plea See United States v Hyde 520 U S 670 1997 holding that plea and plea agreement need not be accepted or rejected as a single unit guilty pleas can be accepted while plea agreements are deferred and the acceptance of the two can be separated in time Similarly the Committee decided to more clearly spell out in Rule 11 d and 11 e the ability of the defendant to withdraw a plea See United States v Hyde supra Amended Rule 11 e is a new provision taken from current Rule 32 e that addresses the finality of a guilty or nolo contendere plea after the court imposes sentence The provision makes it clear that it is not possible for a defendant to withdraw a plea after sentence is imposed The reference to a motion under 28 U S C § 2255 has been changed to the broader term collateral attack to recognize that in some instances a court may grant collateral relief under provisions other than § 2255 See United States v Jeffers 234 F 3d 277 5th Cir 2000 petition under § 2241 may be appropriate where remedy under § 2255 is ineffective or inadequate Currently Rule 11 e 5 requires that unless good cause is shown the parties are to give pretrial notice to the court that a plea agreement exists That provision has been deleted First the Committee believed that although the provision was originally drafted to assist judges under current practice few counsel would risk the consequences in the ordinary case of not informing the court that an agreement exists Secondly the Committee was concerned that there might be rare cases where the parties might agree that informing the court of the existence of an agreement might endanger a defendant or compromise an ongoing investigation in a related case In the end the Committee believed that on balance it would be preferable to remove the provision and reduce the risk of pretrial disclosure Finally revised Rule 11 f which addresses the issue of admissibility or inadmissibility of pleas and statements made during the plea inquiry cross references Federal Rule of Evidence 410 Committee Notes on Rules — 2007 Amendment Subdivision b 1 M The amendment conforms Rule 11 to the Supreme Court s decision in United States v Booker 543 U S 220 2005 Booker held that the provision of the federal sentencing statute that makes the Guidelines mandatory 18 U S C § 3553 b 1 violates the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial With this provision severed and excised the Court held the Sentencing Reform Act makes the Guidelines effectively advisory and requires a sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges see 18 U S C A § 3553 a 4 Supp 2004 but it permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well see § 3553 a Supp 2004 Id at 245 – 46 Rule 11 b M incorporates this analysis into the information provided to the defendant at the time of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere Changes Made to Proposed Amendment Released for Public Comment No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment as released for public comment One change was made to the Committee note The reference to the Fifth Amendment was deleted from the description of the Supreme Court s decision in Booker Committee Notes on Rules — 2013 Amendment Subdivision b 1 O The amendment requires the court to include a general statement that there may be immigration consequences of conviction in the advice provided to the defendant before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere For a defendant who is not a citizen of the United States a criminal conviction may lead to removal exclusion and the inability to become a citizen In Padilla v Kentucky 130 S Ct 1473 2010 the Supreme Court held that a defense attorney s failure to advise the defendant concerning the risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of reasonable professional assistance guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment The amendment mandates a generic warning not specific advice concerning the defendant s individual situation Judges in many districts already include a warning about immigration consequences in the plea colloquy and the amendment adopts this practice as good policy The Committee concluded that the most effective and efficient method of conveying this information is to provide it to every defendant without attempting to determine the defendant s citizenship Changes Made After Publication and Comment The Committee Note was revised to make it clear that the court is to give a general statement that there may be immigration consequences not specific advice concerning a defendant s individual situation References in Text The Federal Rules of

pleas to the jurisdiction pleas in abatement demurrers special pleas in bar and motions to quash A motion to dismiss or for other appropriate relief is substituted for the purpose of raising all defenses and objections heretofore interposed in any of the foregoing modes This should result in a reduction of opportunities for dilatory tactics and at the same time relieve the defense of embarrassment Many competent practitioners have been baffled and mystified by the distinctions between pleas in abatement pleas in bar demurrers and motions to quash and have at times found difficulty in determining which of these should be invoked Homer Cummings 29 A B A Jour 655 See also Medalie 4 Lawyers Guild R 3 1 4 2 A similar change was introduced by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 7 a which has proven successful It is also proposed by the A L I Code of Criminal Procedure Sec 209 Note to Subdivision b 1 and 2 These two paragraphs classify into two groups all objections and defenses to be interposed by motion prescribed by Rule 12 a In one group are defenses and objections which must be raised by motion failure to do so constituting a waiver In the other group are defenses and objections which at the defendant s option may be raised by motion failure to do so however not constituting a waiver Cf Rule 12 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [ 28 U S C Appendix ] In the first of these groups are included all defenses and objections that are based on defects in the institution of the prosecution or in the indictment and information other than lack of jurisdiction or failure to charge an offense All such defenses and objections must be included in a single motion Cf Rule 12 g of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [ 28 U S C Appendix ] Among the defenses and objections in this group are the following Illegal selection or organization of the grand jury disqualification of individual grand jurors presence of unauthorized persons in the grand jury room other irregularities in grand jury proceedings defects in indictment or information other than lack of jurisdiction or failure to state an offense etc The provision that these defenses and objections are waived if not raised by motion substantially continues existing law as they are waived at present unless raised before trial by plea in abatement demurrer motion to quash etc In the other group of objections and defenses which the defendant at his option may raise by motion before trial are included all defenses and objections which are capable of determination without a trial of the general issue They include such matters as former jeopardy former conviction former acquittal statute of limitations immunity lack of jurisdiction failure of indictment or information to state an offense etc Such matters have been heretofore raised by demurrers special pleas in bar and motions to quash Note to Subdivision b 3 This rule while requiring the motion to be made before pleading vests discretionary authority in the court to permit the motion to be made within a reasonable time thereafter The rule supersedes 18 U S C 556a [ now 3288 3289 ] fixing a definite limitation of time for pleas in abatement and motions to quash The rule also eliminates the requirement for technical withdrawal of a plea if it is desired to interpose a preliminary objection or defense after the plea has been entered Under this rule a plea will be permitted to stand in the meantime Note to Subdivision b 4 This rule substantially restates existing law It leaves with the court discretion to determine in advance of trial defenses and objections raised by motion or to defer them for determination at the trial It preserves the right to jury trial in those cases in which the right is given under the Constitution or by statute In all other cases it vests in the court authority to determine issues of fact in such manner as the court deems appropriate Note to Subdivision b 5 1 The first sentence substantially restates existing law 18 U S C [ former ] 561 Indictments and presentments judgment on demurrer which provides that in case a demurrer to an indictment or information is overruled the judgment shall be respondeat ouster 2 The last sentence of the rule that Nothing in this rule shall be deemed to affect the provisions of any act of Congress relating to periods of limitations is intended to preserve the provisions of statutes which permit a reindictment if the original indictment is found defective or is dismissed for other irregularities and the statute of limitations has run in the meantime 18 U S C 587 [ now 3288 ] Defective indictment defect found after period of limitations reindictment Id sec 588 [ now 3289 ] Defective indictment defect found

objections to drawing or qualification of grand jury time for filing suspension of statute of limitations Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1974 Amendment Subdivision a remains as it was in the old rule It speaks only of defenses and objections that prior to the rules could have been raised by a plea demurrer or motion to quash C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure Criminal § 191 at p 397 1969 and this might be interpreted as limiting the scope of the rule However some courts have assumed that old rule 12 does apply to pretrial motions generally and the amendments to subsequent subdivisions of the rule should make clear that the rule is applicable to pretrial motion practice generally See e g rule 12 b 3 4 5 and rule 41 e Subdivision b is changed to provide for some additional motions and requests which must be made prior to trial Subdivisions b 1 and 2 are restatements of the old rule Subdivision b 3 makes clear that objections to evidence on the ground that it was illegally obtained must be raised prior to trial This is the current rule with regard to evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search See rule 41 e C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure Criminal § 673 1969 Supp 1971 It is also the practice with regard to other forms of illegality such as the use of unconstitutional means to obtain a confession See C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure Criminal § 673 at p 108 1969 It seems apparent that the same principle should apply whatever the claimed basis for the application of the exclusionary rule of evidence may be This is consistent with the court s statement in Jones v United States 362 U S 257 264 80 S Ct 725 4 L Ed 2d 697 1960 This provision of Rule 41 e requiring the motion to suppress to be made before trial is a crystallization of decisions of this Court requiring that procedure and is designed to eliminate from the trial disputes over police conduct not immediately relevant to the question of guilt Emphasis added Subdivision b 4 provides for a pretrial request for discovery by either the defendant or the government to the extent to which such discovery is authorized by rule 16 Subdivision b 5 provides for a pretrial request for a severance as authorized in rule 14 Subdivision c provides that a time for the making of motions shall be fixed at the time of the arraignment or as soon thereafter as practicable by court rule or direction of a judge The rule leaves to the individual judge whether the motions may be oral or written This and other amendments to rule 12 are designed to make possible and to encourage the making of motions prior to trial whenever possible and in a single hearing rather than in a series of hearings This is the recommendation of the American Bar Association s Committee on Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial Approved Draft 1970 see especially §§ 5 2 and 5 3 It also is the procedure followed in those jurisdictions which have used the so called omnibus hearing originated by Judge James Carter in the Southern District of California See 4 Defender Newsletter 44 1967 Miller The Omnibus Hearing — An Experiment in Federal Criminal Discovery 5 San Diego L Rev 293 1968 American Bar Association Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial Appendices B C and D Approved Draft 1970 The omnibus hearing is also being used on an experimental basis in several other district courts Although the Advisory Committee is of the view that it would be premature to write the omnibus hearing procedure into the rules it is of the view that the single pretrial hearing should be made possible and its use encouraged by the rules There is a similar trend in state practice See e g State ex rel Goodchild v Burke 27 Wis 2d 244 133 N W 2d 753 1965 State ex rel Rasmussen v Tahash 272 Minn 539 141 N W 2d 3 1965 The rule provides that the motion date be set at the arraignment or as soon thereafter as practicable This is the practice in some federal courts including those using the omnibus hearing In order to obtain the advantage of the omnibus hearing counsel routinely plead not guilty at the initial arraignment on the information or indictment and then may indicate a desire to change the plea to guilty following the omnibus hearing This practice builds a more adequate record in guilty plea cases The rule further provides that the date may be set before the arraignment if local rules of court so provide Subdivision d provides a mechanism for insuring that a defendant knows of the government s intention to use evidence to which the defendant may want to object On some occasions the resolution of the admissibility issue prior to trial may be advantageous to the government In these situations the attorney for the government can make effective defendant s obligation to make his motion to suppress prior to trial by giving defendant notice of the government s intention to use certain evidence For example in United States v Desist 384 F 2d 889 897 2d Cir 1967 the court said Early in the pre trial proceedings the Government commendably informed both the court and defense counsel that an electronic listening device had been used in investigating the case and suggested a hearing be held as to its legality See also the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 18 U S C § 2518 9 The contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom shall not be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial hearing or other proceeding in a Federal or State court unless each party not less than ten days before the trial hearing or proceeding has been furnished with a copy of the court order and accompanying application under which the interception was authorized or approved In cases in which defendant wishes to know what types of evidence the government intends to use so that he can make his motion to suppress prior to trial he can request the government to give notice of its intention to use specified evidence which the defendant is entitled to discover under rule 16 Although the defendant is already entitled to discovery of such evidence prior to trial under rule 16 rule 12 makes it possible for him to avoid the necessity of moving to suppress evidence which the government does not intend to use No sanction is provided for the government s failure to comply with the court s order because the committee believes that attorneys for the government will in fact comply and that judges have ways of insuring compliance An automatic exclusion of such evidence particularly where the failure to give notice was not deliberate seems to create too heavy a burden upon the exclusionary rule of evidence especially when defendant has opportunity for broad discovery under rule 16 Compare ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice Standards Relating to Electronic Surveillance Approved Draft 1971 at p 116 A failure to comply with the duty of giving notice could lead to the suppression of evidence Nevertheless the standards make it explicit that the rule is intended to be a matter of procedure which need not under appropriate circumstances automatically dictate that evidence otherwise admissible be suppressed Pretrial notice by the prosecution of its intention to use evidence which may be subject to a motion to suppress is increasingly being encouraged in state practice See e g State ex rel Goodchild v Burke 27 Wis 2d 244 264 133 N W 2d 753 763 1965 In the interest of better administration of criminal justice we suggest that wherever practicable the prosecutor should within a reasonable time before trial notify the defense as to whether any alleged confession or admission will be offered in evidence at the trial We also suggest in cases where such notice is given by the prosecution that the defense if it intends to attack the confession or admission as involuntary notify the prosecutor of a desire by the defense for a special determination on such issue See also State ex rel Rasmussen v Tahash 272 Minn 539 553 – 556 141 N W 2d 3 13 – 15 1965 At the time of arraignment when a defendant pleads not guilty or as soon as possible thereafter the state will advise the court as to whether its case against the defendant will include evidence obtained as the result of a search and seizure evidence discovered because of a confession or statements in the nature of a confession obtained from the defendant or confessions or statements in the nature of confessions Upon being so informed the court will formally advise the attorney for the defendant or the defendant himself if he refuses legal counsel that he may if he chooses move the court to suppress the evidence so secured or the confession so obtained if his contention is that such evidence was secured or confession obtained in violation of defendant s constitutional rights * * * The procedure which we have outlined deals only with evidence obtained as the result of a search and seizure and evidence consisting of or produced by confession on the part of the defendant However the steps which have been suggested as a method of dealing with evidence of this type will indicate to counsel and to the trial courts that the pretrial consideration of other evidentiary problems the resolution of which is needed to assure the integrity of the trial when conducted will be most useful and that this court encourages the use of such procedures whenever practical Subdivision e provides that the court shall rule on a pretrial motion before trial unless the court orders that it be decided upon at the trial of the general issue or after verdict This is the old rule The reference to issues which must be tried by the jury is dropped as unnecessary without any intention of changing current law or practice The old rule begs the question of when a jury decision is required at the trial providing only that a jury is necessary if required by the Constitution or an act of Congress It will be observed that subdivision e confers general authority to defer the determination of any pretrial motion until after verdict However in the case of a motion to suppress evidence the power should be exercised in the light of the possibility that if the motion is ultimately granted a retrial of the defendant may not be permissible Subdivision f provides that a failure to raise the objections or make the requests specified in subdivision b constitutes a waiver thereof but the court is allowed to grant relief from the waiver if adequate cause is shown See C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure Criminal § 192 1969 where it is pointed out that the old rule is unclear as to whether the waiver results only from a failure to raise the issue prior to trial or from the failure to do so at the time fixed by the judge for a hearing The amendment makes clear that the defendant and where appropriate the government have an obligation to raise the issue at the motion date set by the judge pursuant to subdivision c Subdivision g requires that a verbatim record be made of pretrial motion proceedings and requires the judge to make a record of his findings of fact and conclusions of law This is desirable if pretrial rulings are to be subject to post conviction review on the record The judge may find and rule orally from the bench so long as a verbatim record is taken There is no necessity of a separate written memorandum containing the judge s findings and conclusions Subdivision h is essentially old rule 12 b 5 except for the deletion of the provision that defendant may plead if the motion is determined adversely to him or if he has already entered a plea that that plea stands This language seems unnecessary particularly in light of the experience in some district courts where a pro forma plea of not guilty is entered at the arraignment pretrial motions are later made and depending upon the outcome the defendant may then change his plea to guilty or persist in his plea of not guilty Notes of Committee on the Judiciary House Report No 94 – 247 1975 Amendment A Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deals with pretrial motions and pleadings The Supreme Court proposed several amendments to it The more significant of these are set out below Subdivision b as proposed to be amended provides that the pretrial motions may be oral or written at the court s discretion It also provides that certain types of motions must be made before trial Subdivision d as proposed to be amended provides that the government either on its own or in response to a request by the defendant must notify the defendant of its intention to use certain evidence in order to give the defendant an opportunity before trial to move to suppress that evidence Subdivision e as proposed to be amended permits the court to defer ruling on a pretrial motion until the trial of the general issue or until after verdict Subdivision f as proposed to be amended provides that the failure before trial to file motions or requests or to raise defenses which must be filed or raised prior to trial results in a waiver However it also provides that the court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver Subdivision g as proposed to be amended requires that a verbatim record be made of the pretrial motion proceedings and that the judge make a record of his findings of fact and conclusions of law B Committee Action The Committee modified subdivision e to permit the court to defer its ruling on a pretrial motion until after the trial only for good cause Moreover the court cannot defer its ruling if to do so will adversely affect a party s right to appeal The Committee believes that the rule proposed by the Supreme Court could deprive the government of its appeal rights under statutes like section 3731 of title 18 of the United States Code Further the Committee hopes to discourage the tendency to reserve rulings on pretrial motions until after verdict in the hope that the jury s verdict will make a ruling unnecessary The Committee also modified subdivision h which deals with what happens when the court grants a pretrial motion based upon a defect in the institution of the prosecution or in the indictment or information The Committee s change provides that when such a motion is granted the court may order that the defendant be continued in custody or that his bail be continued for a specified time A defendant should not automatically be continued in custody when such a motion is granted In order to continue the defendant in custody the court must not only determine that there is probable cause but it must also determine in effect that there is good cause to have the defendant arrested Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1983 Amendment Note to Subdivision i As noted in the recent decision of United States v Raddatz 447 U S 667 1980 hearings on pretrial suppression motions not infrequently necessitate a determination of the credibility of witnesses In such a situation it is particularly important as also highlighted by Raddatz that the record include some other evidence which tends to either verify or controvert the assertions of the witness This is especially true in light of the Raddatz holding that a district judge in order to make an independent evaluation of credibility is not required to rehear testimony on which a magistrate based his findings and recommendations following a suppression hearing before the magistrate One kind of evidence which can often fulfill this function is prior statements of the testifying witness yet courts have consistently held that in light of the Jencks Act 18 U S C § 3500 such production of statements cannot be compelled at a pretrial suppression hearing United States v Spagnuolo 515 F 2d 818 9th Cir 1975 United States v Sebastian 497 F 2d 1267 2nd Cir 1974 United States v Montos 421 F 2d 215 5th Cir 1970 This result which finds no express Congressional approval in the legislative history of the Jencks Act see United States v Sebastian supra United States v Covello 410 F 2d 536 2d Cir 1969 would be obviated by new subdivision i of rule 12 This change will enhance the accuracy of the factual determinations made in the context of pretrial suppression hearings As noted in United States v Sebastian supra it can be argued most persuasively that the case for pre trial disclosure is strongest in the framework of a suppression hearing Since findings at such a hearing as to admissibility of challenged evidence will often determine the result at trial and at least in the case of fourth amendment suppression motions cannot be relitigated later before the trier of fact pre trial production of the statements of witnesses would aid defense counsel s impeachment efforts at perhaps the most crucial point in the case * * * [ A ] government witness at the suppression hearing may not appear at trial so that defendants could never test his credibility with the benefits of Jencks Act material The latter statement is certainly correct for not infrequently a police officer who must testify on a motion to suppress as to the circumstances of an arrest or search will not be called at trial because he has no information necessary to the determination of defendant s guilt See e g United States v Spagnuolo supra dissent notes that under the prosecution s own admission it did not intend to produce at trial the witnesses called at the pre trial suppression hearing Moreover even if that person did testify at the trial if that testimony went to a different subject matter then under rule 26 2 c only portions of prior statements covering the same subject matter need be produced and thus portions which might contradict the suppression hearing testimony would not be revealed Thus while it may be true as declared in United States v Montos supra that due process does not require premature production at pre trial hearings on motions to suppress of statements ultimately subject to discovery under the Jencks Act the fact of the matter is that those statements — or the essential portions thereof — are not necessarily subject to later discovery Moreover it is not correct to assume that somehow the problem can be solved by leaving the suppression issue open in some fashion for resolution once the trial is under way at which time the prior statements will be produced In United States v Spagnuolo supra the court responded to the defendant s dilemma of inaccessible prior statements by saying that the suppression motion could simply be deferred until trial But under the current version of rule 12 this is not possible subdivision b declares that motions to suppress must be made before trial and subdivision e says such motions cannot be deferred for determination at trial if a party s right to appeal is adversely affected which surely is the case as to suppression motions As for the possibility of the trial judge reconsidering the motion to suppress on the basis of prior statements produced at trial and casting doubt on the credibility of a suppression hearing witness it is not a desirable or adequate solution For one thing as already noted there is no assurance that the prior statements will be forthcoming Even if they are it is not efficient to delay the continuation of the trial to undertake a reconsideration of matters which could have been resolved in advance of trial had the critical facts then been available Furthermore if such reconsideration is regularly to be expected of the trial judge then this would give rise on appeal to unnecessary issues of the kind which confronted the court in United States v Montos supra — whether the trial judge was obligated either to conduct a new hearing or to make a new determination in light of the new evidence The second sentence of subdivision i provides that a law enforcement officer is to be deemed a witness called by the government This means that when such a federal state or local officer has testified at a suppression hearing the defendant will be entitled to any statement of the officer in the possession of the government and relating to the subject matter concerning which the witness has testified without regard to whether the officer was in fact called by the government or the defendant There is considerable variation in local practice as to whether the arresting or searching officer is considered the witness of the defendant or of the government but the need for the prior statement exists in either instance The second sentence of subdivision i also provides that upon a claim of privilege the court is to excise the privileged matter before turning over the statement The situation most likely to arise is that in which the prior statement of the testifying officer identifies an informant who supplied some or all of the probable cause information to the police Under McCray v Illinois 386 U S 300 1967 it is for the judge who hears the motion to decide whether disclosure of the informant s identity is necessary in the particular case Of course the government in any case may prevent disclosure of the informant s identity by terminating reliance upon information from that informant Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment The amendments are technical No substantive change is intended Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1993 Amendment The amendment to subdivision i is one of a series of contemporaneous amendments to Rules 26 2 32 f 32 1 46 and Rule 8 of the Rules Governing § 2255 Hearings which extended Rule 26 2 Production of Witness Statements to other proceedings or hearings conducted under the Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule 26 2 c now explicitly states that the trial court may excise privileged matter from the requested witness statements That change rendered similar language in Rule 12 i redundant Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 12 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only except as noted below The last sentence of current Rule 12 a referring to the elimination of all other pleas and demurrers and motions to quash has been deleted as unnecessary Rule 12 b is modified to more clearly indicate that Rule 47 governs any pretrial motions filed under Rule 12 including form and content The new provision also more clearly delineates those motions that must be filed pretrial and those that may be filed pretrial No change in practice is intended Rule 12 b 4 is composed of what is currently Rule 12 d The Committee believed that that provision which addresses the government s requirement to disclose discoverable information for the purpose of facilitating timely defense objections and motions was more appropriately associated with the pretrial motions specified in Rule 12 b 3 Rule 12 c includes a non stylistic change The reference to the local rule exception has been deleted to make it clear that judges should be encouraged to set deadlines for motions The Committee believed that doing so promotes more efficient case management especially when there is a heavy docket of pending cases Although the rule permits some discretion in setting a date for motion hearings the Committee believed that doing so at an early point in the proceedings would also promote judicial economy Moving the language in current Rule 12 d caused the relettering of the subdivisions following Rule 12 c Although amended Rule 12 e is a revised version of current Rule 12 f the Committee intends to make no change in the current law regarding waivers of motions or defenses Committee Notes on Rules — 2014 Amendment Rule 12 b 1 The language formerly in b 2 which provided that any defense objection or request that the court can determine without trial of the general issue may be raised by motion before trial has been relocated here The more modern phrase trial on the merits is substituted for the more archaic phrase trial of the general issue No change in meaning is intended Rule 12 b 2 As revised subdivision b 2 states that lack of jurisdiction may be raised at any time the case is pending This provision was relocated from its previous placement at the end of subsection b 3 B and restyled No change in meaning is intended Rule 12 b 3 The amendment clarifies which motions must be raised before trial The introductory language includes two important limitations The basis for the motion must be one that is then reasonably available and the motion must be one that the court can determine without trial on the merits The types of claims subject to Rule 12 b 3 generally will be available before trial and they can — and should — be resolved then The Committee recognized however that in some cases a party may not have access to the information needed to raise particular claims that fall within the general categories subject to Rule 12 b 3 prior to trial The then reasonably available language is intended to ensure that a claim a party could not have raised on time is not subject to the limitation on review imposed by Rule 12 c 3 Additionally only those issues that can be determined without a trial on the merits need be raised by motion before trial Just as in b 1 the more modern phrase trial on the merits is substituted for the more archaic phrase trial of the general issue No change in meaning is intended The rule s command that motions alleging a defect in instituting the prosecution and errors in the indictment or information must be made before trial is unchanged The amendment adds a nonexclusive list of commonly raised claims under each category to help ensure that such claims are not overlooked The Rule is not intended to and does not affect or supersede statutory provisions that establish the time to make specific motions such as motions under the Jury Selection and Service Act 18 U S C § 1867 a [ 28 U S C § 1867 a ] Rule 12 b 3 B has also been amended to remove language that allowed the court at any time while the case is pending to hear a claim that the indictment or information fails to state an offense This specific charging error was previously considered fatal whenever raised and was excluded from the general requirement that charging deficiencies be raised prior to trial The Supreme Court abandoned any jurisdictional justification for the exception in United States v Cotton 535 U S 625 629 31 2002 overruling Ex parte Bain 121 U S 1 1887 [ i ] nsofar as it held that a defective indictment deprives a court of jurisdiction Rule 12 c As revised subdivision c governs both the deadline for making pretrial motions and the consequences of failing to meet the deadline for motions that must be made before trial under Rule 12 b 3 As amended subdivision c contains three paragraphs Paragraph c 1 retains the existing provisions for establishing the time when pretrial motions must be made and adds a sentence stating that unless the court sets a deadline the deadline for pretrial motions is the start of trial so that motions may be ruled upon before jeopardy attaches Subdivision e of the present rule contains the language or by any extension the court provides which anticipates that a district court has broad discretion to extend reset or decline to extend or reset the deadline for pretrial motions New paragraph c 2 recognizes this discretion explicitly and relocates the Rule s mention of it to a more logical place — after the provision concerning setting the deadline and before the provision concerning the consequences of not meeting the deadline No change in meaning is intended New paragraph c 3 governs the review of untimely claims previously addressed in Rule 12 e Rule 12 e provided that a party waives a defense not raised within the time set under Rule 12 c Although the term waiver in the context of a criminal case ordinarily refers to the intentional relinquishment of a known right Rule 12 e has never required any determination that a party who failed to make a timely motion intended to relinquish a defense objection or request that was not raised in a timely fashion Accordingly to avoid possible confusion the Committee decided not to employ the term waiver in new paragraph c 3 New paragraph 12 c 3 retains the existing standard for untimely claims The party seeking relief must show good cause for failure to raise a claim by the deadline a flexible standard that requires consideration of all interests in the particular case Rule 12 e The effect of failure to raise issues by a pretrial motion has been relocated from e to c 3 Changes Made After Publication and Comment Language that had been deleted from Rule 12 b 2 as unnecessary was restored and relocated in b 1 The change begins the Rule s treatment of pretrial motions with an appropriate general statement and responds to concerns that the deletion might have been perceived as unintentionally restricting the district courts authority to rule on pretrial motions The references to double jeopardy and statute of limitations were dropped from the nonexclusive list in b 3 A to permit further debate over the treatment of such claims New paragraph c 2 was added to state explicitly the district court s authority to extend or reset the deadline for pretrial motions this authority had been recognized implicitly in language being deleted from Rule 12 e In subdivision c the cross reference to Rule 52 was omitted as unnecessarily controversial In subparagraph c 3 the current language good cause was retained for all claims and subparagraph c 3 B was omitted Finally the Committee Note was amended to reflect these post publication changes and to state explicitly that the rule is not intended to change or supersede statutory deadlines under provisions such as the Jury Selection and Service Act Amendment by Public Law 1975 — Pub L 94 – 64 amended subds e and h generally Effective Date of Amendments Proposed April 22 1974 Effective Date of 1975 Amendments Amendments of this rule embraced in the order of the United States Supreme Court on Apr 22 1974 and the amendments of this rule made by section 3 of Pub L 94 – 64 effective Dec 1 1975 see section 2 of Pub L 94 – 64 set out as a note under rule 4 of these rules Rule 12 1 Notice of an Alibi Defense a Government s Request for Notice and Defendant s Response 1 Government s Request An attorney for the government may request in writing that the defendant notify an attorney for the government of any intended alibi defense The request must state the time date and place of the alleged offense 2 Defendant s Response Within 14 days after the request or at some other time the court sets the defendant must serve written notice on an attorney for the government of any intended alibi defense The defendant s notice must state A each specific place where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense and B the name address and telephone number of each alibi witness on whom the defendant intends to rely b Disclosing Government Witnesses 1 Disclosure A In General If the defendant serves a Rule 12 1 a 2 notice an attorney for the government must disclose in writing to the defendant or the defendant s attorney i the name of each witness — and the address and telephone number of each witness other than a victim — that the government intends to rely on to establish that the defendant was present at the scene of the alleged offense and ii each government rebuttal witness to the defendant s alibi defense B Victim s Address and Telephone Number If the government intends to rely on a victim s testimony to establish that the defendant was present at the scene of the alleged offense and the defendant establishes a need for the victim s address and telephone number the court may i order the government to provide the information in writing to the defendant or the defendant s attorney or ii fashion a reasonable procedure that allows preparation of the defense and also protects the victim s interests 2 Time to Disclose Unless the court directs otherwise an attorney for the government must give its Rule 12 1 b 1 disclosure within 14 days after the defendant serves notice of an intended alibi defense under Rule 12 1 a 2 but no later than 14 days before trial c Continuing Duty to Disclose 1 In General Both an attorney for the government and the defendant must promptly disclose in writing to the other party the name of each additional witness — and the address and telephone number of each additional witness other than a victim — if A the disclosing party learns of the witness before or during trial and B the witness should have been disclosed under Rule 12 1 a or b if the disclosing party had known of the witness earlier 2 Address and Telephone Number of an Additional Victim Witness The address and telephone number of an additional victim witness must not be disclosed except as provided in Rule 12 1 b 1 B d For good cause the court may grant an exception to any requirement of Rule 12 1 a – c e Failure to Comply If a party fails to comply with this rule the court may exclude the testimony of any undisclosed witness regarding the defendant s alibi This rule does not limit the defendant s right to testify f Inadmissibility of Withdrawn Intention Evidence of an intention to rely on an alibi

1 2009 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1974 Rule 12 1 is new See rule 87 of the United States District Court Rules for the District of Columbia for a somewhat comparable provision The Advisory Committee has dealt with the issue of notice of alibi on several occasions over the course of the past three decades In the Preliminary Draft of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 1943 and the Second Preliminary Draft 1944 an alibi notice rule was proposed But the Advisory Committee was closely divided upon whether there should be a rule at all and if there were to be a rule what the form of the rule should be Orfield The Preliminary Draft of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 22 Texas L Rev 37 57 – 58 1943 The principal disagreement was whether the prosecutor or the defendant should initiate the process The Second Preliminary Draft published in 1944 required the defendant to initiate the process by a motion to require the government to state with greater particularity the time and place it would rely on Upon receipt of this information defendant was required to give his notice of alibi This formulation was vehemently objected to by five members of the committee out of a total of eighteen and two alternative rule proposals were submitted to the Supreme Court Both formulations — one requiring the prosecutor to initiate the process the other requiring the defendant to initiate the process — were rejected by the Court See Epstein Advance Notice of Alibi 55 J Crim L C & P S 29 30 1964 in which the view is expressed that the unresolved split over the rule probably caused the court to reject an alibi notice rule Rule 12 1 embodies an intermediate position The initial burden is upon the defendant to raise the defense of alibi but he need not specify the details of his alibi defense until the government specifies the time place and date of alleged offense Each party must at the appropriate time disclose the names and addresses of witnesses In 1962 the Advisory Committee drafted an alibi notice rule and included it in the Preliminary Draft of December 1962 rule 12A at pp 5 – 6 This time the Advisory Committee withdrew the rule without submitting it to the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure Wright Proposed Changes in Federal Civil Criminal and Appellate Procedure 35 F R D 317 326 1964 Criticism of the December 1962 alibi notice rule centered on constitutional questions and questions of general fairness to the defendant See Everett Discovery in Criminal Cases — In Search of a Standard 1964 Duke L J 477 497 – 499 Doubts about the constitutionality of a notice of alibi rule were to some extent resolved by Williams v Florida 399 U S 78 90 S Ct 1893 26 L Ed 2d 446 1970 In that case the court sustained the constitutionality of the Florida notice of alibi statute but left unresolved two important questions 1 The court said that it was not holding that a notice of alibi requirement was valid under conditions where a defendant does not enjoy reciprocal discovery against the State 399 U S at 82 n 11 90 S Ct 1893 Under the revision of rule 16 the defendant is entitled to substantially enlarged discovery in federal cases and it would seem appropriate to conclude that the rules will comply with the reciprocal discovery qualification of the Williams decision [ See Wardius v Oregon 412 U S 470 93 S Ct 2208 37 L Ed 2d 82 1973 was decided after the approval of proposed Rule 12 1 by the Judicial Conference of the United States In that case the Court held the Oregon Notice of Alibi statute unconstitutional because of the failure to give the defendant adequate reciprocal discovery rights ] 2 The court said that it did not consider the question of the validity of the threatened sanction had petitioner chosen not to comply with the notice of alibi rule 399 U S at 83 n 14 90 S Ct 1893 This issue remains unresolved [ See Wardius v Oregon 412 U S at 472 Note 4 93 S Ct 2208 ] Rule 12 1 e provides that the court may exclude the testimony of any witness whose name has not been disclosed pursuant to the requirements of the rule The defendant may however testify himself Prohibiting from testifying a witness whose name was not disclosed is a common provision in state statutes See Epstein supra at 35 It is generally assumed that the sanction is essential if the notice of alibi rule is to have practical significance See Epstein supra at 36 The use of the term may is intended to make clear that the judge may allow the alibi witness to testify if under the particular circumstances there is cause shown for the failure to conform to the requirements of the rules This is further emphasized by subdivision f which provides for exceptions whenever good cause is shown for the exception The Supreme Court of Illinois recently upheld an Illinois statute which requires a defendant to give notice of his alibi witnesses although the prosecution is not required to disclose its alibi rebuttal witnesses People v Holiday 47 Ill 2d 300 265 N E 2d 634 1970 Because the defense complied with the requirement the court did not have to consider the propriety of penalizing noncompliance The requirement of notice of alibi seems to be an increasingly common requirement of state criminal procedure State statutes and court rules are cited in 399 U S at 82 n 11 90 S Ct 1893 See also Epstein supra Rule 12 1 will serve a useful purpose even though rule 16 now requires disclosure of the names and addresses of government and defense witnesses There are cases in which the identity of defense witnesses may be known but it may come as a surprise to the government that they intend to testify as to an alibi and there may be no advance notice of the details of the claimed alibi The result often is an unnecessary interruption and delay in the trial to enable the government to conduct an appropriate investigation The objective of rule 12 1 is to prevent this by providing a mechanism which will enable the parties to have specific information in advance of trial to prepare to meet the issue of alibi during the trial Notes of Committee on the Judiciary House Report No 94 – 247 1975 Amendment A Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court Rule 12 1 is a new rule that deals with the defense of alibi It provides that a defendant must notify the government of his intention to rely upon the defense of alibi Upon receipt of such notice the government must advise the defendant of the specific time date and place at which the offense is alleged to have been committed The defendant must then inform the government of the specific place at which he claims to have been when the offense is alleged to have been committed and of the names and addresses of the witnesses on whom he intends to rely to establish his alibi The government must then inform the defendant of the names and addresses of the witnesses on whom it will rely to establish the defendant s presence at the scene of the crime If either party fails to comply with the provisions of the rule the court may exclude the testimony of any witness whose identity is not disclosed The rule does not attempt to limit the right of the defendant to testify in his own behalf B Committee Action The Committee disagrees with the defendant triggered procedures of the rule proposed by the Supreme Court The major purpose of a notice of alibi rule is to prevent unfair surprise to the prosecution The Committee therefore believes that it should be up to the prosecution to trigger the alibi defense discovery procedures If the prosecution is worried about being surprised by an alibi defense it can trigger the alibi defense discovery procedures If the government fails to trigger the procedures and if the defendant raises an alibi defense at trial then the government cannot claim surprise and get a continuance of the trial The Committee has adopted a notice of alibi rule similar to the one now used in the District of Columbia [ See Rule 2 – 5 b of the Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia See also Rule 16 – 1 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia ] The rule is prosecution triggered If the prosecutor notifies the defendant of the time place and date of the alleged offense then the defendant has 10 days in which to notify the prosecutor of his intention to rely upon an alibi defense specify where he claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense and provide a list of his alibi witnesses The prosecutor within 10 days but no later than 10 days before trial must then provide the defendant with a list of witnesses who will place the defendant at the scene of the alleged crime and those witnesses who will be used to rebut the defendant s alibi witnesses The Committee s rule does not operate only to the benefit of the prosecution In fact its rule will provide the defendant with more information than the rule proposed by the Supreme Court The rule proposed by the Supreme Court permits the defendant to obtain a list of only those witnesses who will place him at the scene of the crime The defendant however would get the names of these witnesses anyway as part of his discovery under Rule 16 a 1 E The Committee rule not only requires the prosecution to provide the names of witnesses who place the defendant at the scene of the crime but it also requires the prosecution to turn over the names of those witnesses who will be called in rebuttal to the defendant s alibi witnesses This is information that the defendant is not otherwise entitled to discover Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1985 Amendment Note to Subdivision f This clarifying amendment is intended to serve the same purpose as a comparable change made in 1979 to similar language in Rule 11 e 6 The change makes it clear that evidence of a withdrawn intent or of statements made in connection therewith is thereafter inadmissible against the person who gave the notice in any civil or criminal proceeding without regard to whether the proceeding is against that person Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment The amendments are technical No substantive change is intended Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 12 1 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only except as noted below Current Rules 12 1 d and 12 1 e have been switched in the amended rule to improve the organization of the rule Finally the amended rule includes a new requirement that in providing the names and addresses of alibi and any rebuttal witnesses the parties must also provide the phone numbers of those witnesses See Rule 12 1 a 2 Rule 12 1 b 1 and Rule 12 1 c The Committee believed that requiring such information would facilitate locating and interviewing those witnesses Committee Notes on Rules — 2008 Amendment Subdivisions b and c The amendment implements the Crime Victims Rights Act which states that victims have the right to be reasonably protected from the accused and to be treated with respect for the victim s dignity and privacy See 18 U S C § 3771 a 1 & 8 The rule provides that a victim s address and telephone number should not automatically be provided to the defense when an alibi defense is raised If a defendant establishes a need for this information the court has discretion to order its disclosure or to fashion an alternative procedure that provides the defendant with the information necessary to prepare a defense but also protects the victim s interests In the case of victims who will testify concerning an alibi claim the same procedures and standards apply to both the prosecutor s initial disclosure and the prosecutor s continuing duty to disclose under subdivision c Changes Made to Proposed Amendment Released for Public Comment The Committee made very minor changes in the text at the suggestion of the Style Consultant The Committee revised the Note in response to public comments omitting the suggestion that the court might upon occasion have the defendant and victim meet Committee Notes on Rules — 2009 Amendment The times set in the former rule

Notice of an Insanity Defense Mental Examination a Notice of an Insanity Defense A defendant who intends to assert a defense of insanity at the time of the alleged offense must so notify an attorney

cannot rely on an insanity defense The court may for good cause allow the defendant to file the notice late grant additional trial preparation time or make other appropriate orders b Notice of Expert

of guilt or 2 the issue of punishment in a capital case the defendant must — within the time provided for filing a pretrial motion or at any later time the court sets — notify an attorney for the government in writing of this intention and file a copy of the notice with the clerk The court may for good cause allow the defendant to file the notice late grant the parties additional trial preparation time or make other appropriate orders c Mental Examination 1 Authority to Order an Examination Procedures A The court may order the defendant to submit to a competency examination under 18 U S C § 4241 B If the defendant provides notice under Rule 12 2 a the court must upon the government s motion order the defendant to be examined under 18 U S C § 4242 If the defendant provides notice under Rule 12 2 b the court may upon the government s motion order the defendant to be examined under procedures ordered by the court 2 Disclosing Results and Reports of Capital Sentencing Examination The results and reports of any examination conducted solely under Rule 12 2 c 1 after notice under Rule 12 2 b 2 must be sealed and must not be disclosed to any attorney for the government or the defendant unless the defendant is found guilty of one or more capital crimes and the defendant confirms an intent to offer during sentencing proceedings expert evidence on mental condition 3 Disclosing Results and Reports of the Defendant s Expert Examination After disclosure under Rule 12 2 c 2 of the results and reports of the government s examination the defendant must disclose to the government the results and reports of any examination on mental condition conducted by the defendant s expert about which the defendant intends to introduce expert evidence 4 Inadmissibility of a Defendant s Statements No statement made by a defendant in the course of any examination conducted under this rule whether conducted with or without the defendant s consent no testimony by the expert based on the statement and no other fruits of the statement may be admitted into evidence against the defendant in any criminal proceeding except on an issue regarding mental condition on which the defendant A has introduced evidence of incompetency or evidence requiring notice under Rule 12 2 a or b 1 or B has introduced expert evidence in a capital sentencing proceeding requiring notice under Rule 12 2 b 2 d Failure to Comply 1 Failure to Give Notice or to Submit to Examination The court may exclude any expert evidence from the defendant on the issue of the defendant s mental disease mental defect or any other mental condition bearing on the defendant s guilt or the issue of punishment in a capital case if the defendant fails to A give notice under Rule 12 2 b or B submit to an examination when ordered under Rule 12 2 c 2 Failure to Disclose The court may exclude any expert evidence for which the defendant has failed to comply with the disclosure requirement of Rule 12 2 c 3 e Inadmissibility of Withdrawn Intention Evidence of an intention as to which notice was given under Rule 12 2 a or b later withdrawn is not in any civil or criminal proceeding admissible against the

Dec 1 2005 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1974 Rule 12 2 is designed to require a defendant to give notice prior to trial of his intention 1 to rely upon the defense of insanity or 2 to introduce expert testimony of mental disease or defect on the theory that such mental condition is inconsistent with the mental state required for the offense charged This rule does not deal with the issue of mental competency to stand trial The objective is to give the government time to prepare to meet the issue which will usually require reliance upon expert testimony Failure to give advance notice commonly results in the necessity for a continuance in the middle of a trial thus unnecessarily delaying the administration of justice A requirement that the defendant give notice of his intention to rely upon the defense of insanity was proposed by the Advisory Committee in the Second Preliminary Draft of Proposed Amendments March 1964 rule 12 1 p 7 The objective of the 1964 proposal was explained in a brief Advisory Committee Note Under existing procedure although insanity is a defense once it is raised the burden to prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt rests with the government Davis v United States 160 U S 469 16 S Ct 353 40 L Ed 499 1895 This rule requires pretrial notice to the government of an insanity defense thus permitting it to prepare to meet the issue Furthermore in Lynch v Overholser 369 U S 705 82 S Ct 1063 8 L Ed 2d 211 1962 the Supreme Court held that at least in the face of a mandatory commitment statute the defendant had a right to determine whether or not to raise the issue of insanity The rule gives the defendant a method of raising the issue and precludes any problem of deciding whether or not the defendant relied on insanity The Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure decided not to recommend the proposed Notice of Insanity rule to the Supreme Court Reasons were not given Requiring advance notice of the defense of insanity is commonly recommended as a desirable procedure The Working Papers of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws Vol 1 p 254 1970 state in part It is recommended that procedural reform provide for advance notice that evidence of mental disease or defect will be relied upon in defense Requiring advance notice is proposed also by the American Law Institute s Model Penal Code § 4 03 P O D 1962 The commentary in Tentative Draft No 4 at 193 – 194 1955 indicates that as of that time six states required pretrial notice and an additional eight states required that the defense of insanity be specially pleaded For recent state statutes see N Y CPL § 250 10 McKinney s Consol Laws c 11 – A 1971 enacted in 1970 which provides that no evidence by a defendant of a mental disease negativing criminal responsibility shall be allowed unless defendant has served notice on the prosecutor of his intention to rely upon such defense See also New Jersey Penal Code Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission Oct 1971 § 2c 4 – 3 New Jersey Court Rule 3 12 State v Whitlow 45 N J 3 22 n 3 210 T 2d 763 1965 holding the requirement of notice to be both appropriate and not in violation of the privilege against self incrimination Subdivision a deals with notice of the defense of insanity In this context the term insanity has a well understood meaning See e g Tydings A Federal Verdict of Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity and a Subsequent Commitment Procedure 27 Md L Rev 131 1967 Precisely how the defense of insanity is phrased does however differ somewhat from circuit to circuit See Study Draft of a New Federal Criminal Code § 503 Comment at 37 USGPO 1970 For a more extensive discussion of present law see Working Papers of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws Vol 1 pp 229 – 247 USGPO 1970 The National Commission recommends the adoption of a single test patterned after the proposal of the American Law Institute s Model Penal Code The proposed definition provides in part In any prosecution for an offense lack of criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect is a defense [ Study Draft of a New Federal Criminal Code § 503 at 36 – 37 ] Should the proposal of the National Commission be adopted by the Congress the language of subdivision a probably ought to be changed to read defense of lack of criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect rather than defense of insanity Subdivision b is intended to deal with the issue of expert testimony bearing upon the issue of whether the defendant had the mental state required for the offense charged There is some disagreement as to whether it is proper to introduce evidence of mental disease or defect bearing not upon the defense of insanity but rather upon the existence of the mental state required by the offense charged The American Law Institute s Model Penal Code takes the position that such evidence is admissible [§ 4 02 1 P O D 1962 ] See also People v Gorshen 51 Cal 2d 716 336 P 2d 492 1959 The federal cases reach conflicting conclusions See Rhodes v United States 282 F 2d 59 62 4th Cir 1960 The proper way would have been to ask the witness to describe the defendant s mental condition and symptoms his pathological beliefs and motivations if he was thus afflicted and to explain how these influenced or could have influenced his behavior particularly his mental capacity knowingly to make the false statement charged or knowingly to forge the signatures * * * Compare Fisher v United States 328 U S 463 66 S Ct 1318 90 L Ed 1382 1946 Subdivision b does not attempt to decide when expert testimony is admissible on the issue of the requisite mental state It provides only that the defendant must give pretrial notice when he intends to introduce such evidence The purpose is to prevent the need for a continuance when such evidence is offered without prior notice The problem of unnecessary delay has arisen in jurisdictions which do not require prior notice of an intention to use expert testimony on the issue of mental state Referring to this the California Special Commission on Insanity and Criminal Offenders First Report 30 1962 said The abuses of the present system are great Under a plea of not guilty without any notice to the people that the defense of insanity will be relied upon defendant has been able to raise the defense upon the trial of the issue as to whether he committed the offense charged As an example of the delay occasioned by the failure to heretofore require a pretrial notice by the defendant see United States v Albright 388 F 2d 719 4th Cir 1968 where a jury trial was recessed for 23 days to permit a psychiatric examination by the prosecution when the defendant injected a surprise defense of lack of mental competency Subdivision c gives the court the authority to order the defendant to submit to a psychiatric examination by a psychiatrist designated by the court A similar provision is found in ALI Model Penal Code § 4 05 1 P O D 1962 This is a common provision of state law the constitutionality of which has been sustained Authorities are collected in ALI Model Penal Code pp 195 – 196 Tent Draft No 4 1955 For a recent proposal see the New Jersey Penal Code § 2c 4 – 5 Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission Oct 1971 authorizing appointment of at least one qualified psychiatrist to examine and report upon the mental condition of the defendant Any issue of self incrimination which might arise can be dealt with by the court as for example by a bifurcated trial which deals separately with the issues of guilt and of mental responsibility For statutory authority to appoint a psychiatrist with respect to competency to stand trial see 18 U S C § 4244 Subdivision d confers authority on the court to exclude expert testimony in behalf of a defendant who has failed to give notice under subdivision b or who refuses to be examined by a court appointed psychiatrist under subdivision c See State v Whitlow 45 N J 3 23 210 A 2d 763 1965 which indicates that it is proper to limit or exclude testimony by a defense psychiatrist whenever defendant refuses to be examined Notes of Committee on the Judiciary House Report No 94 – 247 1975 Amendment A Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court Rule 12 2 is a new rule that deals with defense based upon mental condition It provides that 1 The defendant must notify the prosecution in writing of his intention to rely upon the defense of insanity If the defendant fails to comply insanity may not be raised as a defense 2 If the defendant intends to introduce expert testimony relating to mental disease or defect on the issue whether he had the requisite mental state he must notify the prosecution in writing 3 The court on motion of the prosecution may order the defendant to submit to a psychiatric examination by a court appointed psychiatrist 4 If the defendant fails to undergo the court ordered psychiatric examination the court may exclude any expert witness the defendant offers on the issue of his mental state B Committee Action The Committee agrees with the proposed rule but has added language concerning the use of statements made to a psychiatrist during the course of a psychiatric examination provided for by Rule 12 2 The language provides No statement made by the accused in the course of any examination provided for by this rule whether the examination shall be with or without the consent of the accused shall be admitted in evidence against the accused before the judge who or jury which determines the guilt of the accused prior to the determination of guilt The purpose of this rule is to secure the defendant s fifth amendment right against self incrimination See State v Raskin 34 Wis 2d 607 150 N W 2d 318 1967 The provision is flexible and does not totally preclude the use of such statements For example the defendant s statement can be used at a separate determination of the issue of sanity or for sentencing purposes once guilt has been determined A limiting instruction to the jury in a single trial to consider statements made to the psychiatrist only on the issue of sanity would not satisfy the requirements of the rule as amended The prejudicial effect on the determination of guilt would be inescapable The Committee notes that the rule does not attempt to resolve the issue whether the court can constitutionally compel a defendant to undergo a psychiatric examination when the defendant is unwilling to undergo one The provisions of subdivision c are qualified by the phrase In an appropriate case If the court cannot constitutionally compel an unwilling defendant to undergo a psychiatric examination then the provisions of subdivision c are inapplicable in every instance where the defendant is unwilling to undergo a court ordered psychiatric examination The Committee by its approval of subdivision c intends to take no stand whatever on the constitutional question Conference Committee Notes House Report No 94 – 414 1975 Amendment Rule 12 2 c deals with court ordered psychiatric examinations The House version provides that no statement made by a defendant during a court ordered psychiatric examination could be admitted in evidence against the defendant before the trier of fact that determines the issue of guilt prior to the determination of guilt The Senate version deletes this provision The Conference adopts a modified House provision and restores to the bill the language of H R 6799 as it was originally introduced The Conference adopted language provides that no statement made by the defendant during a psychiatric examination provided for by the rule shall be admitted against him on the issue of guilt in any criminal proceeding The Conference believes that the provision in H R 6799 as originally introduced in the House adequately protects the defendant s fifth amendment right against self incrimination The rule does not preclude use of statements made by a defendant during a court ordered psychiatric examination The statements may be relevant to the issue of defendant s sanity and admissible on that issue However a limiting instruction would not satisfy the rule if a statement is so prejudicial that a limiting instruction would be ineffective Cf practice under 18 U S C 4244 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1983 Amendment Note to Subdivision b Courts have recently experienced difficulty with the question of what kind of expert testimony offered for what purpose falls within the notice requirement of rule 12 2 b See e g United States v Hill 655 F 2d 512 3d Cir 1980 rule not applicable to tendered testimony of psychologist concerning defendant s susceptibility of inducement offered to reinforce defendant s entrapment defense United States v Webb 625 F 2d 709 5th Cir 1980 rule not applicable to expert testimony tendered to show that defendant lacked the propensity to commit a violent act as this testimony was offered to prove that Webb did not commit the offense charged shooting at a helicopter not that certain conduct was unaccompanied by criminal intent United States v Perl 584 F 2d 1316 4th Cir 1978 because entrapment defense properly withheld from jury it was unnecessary to decide if the district court erred in holding rule applicable to tendered testimony of the doctor that defendant had increased susceptibility to suggestion as a result of medication he was taking United States v Olson 576 F 2d 1267 8th Cir 1978 rule applicable to tendered testimony of an alcoholism and drug therapist that defendant was not responsible for his actions because of a problem with alcohol United States v Staggs 553 F 2d 1073 7th Cir 1977 rule applicable to tendered testimony of psychologist that defendant charged with assaulting federal officer was more likely to hurt himself than to direct his aggressions toward others as this testimony bears upon whether defendant intended to put victim in apprehension when he picked up the gun What these cases illustrate is that expert testimony about defendant s mental condition may be tendered in a wide variety of circumstances well beyond the situation clearly within rule 12 2 b i e where a psychiatrist testifies for the defendant regarding his diminished capacity In all of these situations and others like them there is good reason to make applicable the notice provisions of rule 12 2 b This is because in all circumstances in which the defendant plans to offer expert testimony concerning his mental condition at the time of the crime charged advance disclosure to the government will serve to permit adequate pretrial preparation to prevent surprise at trial and to avoid the necessity of delays during trial 2 A B A Standards for Criminal Justice 11 – 55 2d 1980 Thus while the district court in United States v Hill 481 F Supp 558 E D Pa 1979 incorrectly concluded that present rule 12 2 b covers testimony by a psychologist bearing on the defense of entrapment the court quite properly concluded that the government would be seriously disadvantaged by lack of notice This would have meant that the government would not have been equipped to cross examine the expert that any expert called by the government would not have had an opportunity to hear the defense expert testify and that the government would not have had an opportunity to conduct the kind of investigation needed to acquire rebuttal testimony on defendant s claim that he was especially susceptible to inducement Consequently rule 12 2 b has been expanded to cover all of the aforementioned situations Note to Subdivision c The amendment of the first sentence of subdivision c recognizing that the government may seek to have defendant subjected to a mental examination by an expert other than a psychiatrist is prompted by the same considerations discussed above Because it is possible that the defendant will submit to examination by an expert of his own other than a psychiatrist it is necessary to recognize that it will sometimes be appropriate for defendant to be examined by a government expert other than a psychiatrist The last sentence of subdivision c has been amended to more accurately reflect the Fifth Amendment considerations at play in this context See Estelle v Smith 451 U S 454 1981 holding that self incrimination protections are not inevitably limited to the guilt phase of a trial and that the privilege when applicable protects against use of defendant s statement and also the fruits thereof including expert testimony based upon defendant s statements to the expert Estelle also intimates that a defendant can be required to submit to a sanity examination and presumably some other form of mental examination when his silence may deprive the State of the only effective means it has of controverting his proof on an issue that he interjected into the case Note to Subdivision d The broader term mental condition is appropriate here in light of the above changes to subdivisions b and c Note to Subdivision e New subdivision e generally consistent with the protection afforded in rule 12 1 f with respect to notice of alibi ensures that the notice required under subdivision b will not deprive the defendant of an opportunity later to elect not to utilize any expert testimony This provision is consistent with Williams v Florida 399 U S 78 1970 holding the privilege against self incrimination is not violated by requiring the defendant to give notice of a defense where the defendant retains the unfettered choice of abandoning the defense Dissenting Statement of Justice O Connor to 1983 Amendment With one minor reservation I join the Court in its adoption of the proposed amendments They represent the product of considerable effort by the Advisory Committee and they will institute desirable reforms My sole disagreement with the Court s action today lies in its failure to recommend correction of an apparent error in the drafting of Proposed Rule 12 2 e As proposed Rule 12 2 e reads Evidence of an intention as to which notice was given under subdivision a or b later withdrawn is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding against the person who gave notice of the intention Identical language formerly appeared in Fed Rules Crim Proc 11 e 6 and Fed Rules Evid 410 each of which stated that [ Certain material ] is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding against the defendant Those rules were amended Supreme Court Order April 30 1979 441 U S 970 987 1007 Pub Law 96 – 42 approved July 31 1979 93 Stat 326 After the amendments the relevant language read [ Certain material ] is not in any civil or criminal proceeding admissible against the defendant As the Advisory Committee explained this minor change was necessary to eliminate an ambiguity Before the amendment the word against could be read as referring either to the kind of proceeding in which the evidence was offered or to the purpose for which it was offered Thus for instance if a person was a witness in a suit but not a party it was unclear whether the evidence could be used to impeach him In such a case the use would be against the person but the proceeding would not be against him Similarly if the person wished to introduce the evidence in a proceeding in which he was the defendant the use but not the proceeding would be against him To eliminate the ambiguity the Advisory Committee proposed the amendment clarifying that the evidence was inadmissible against the person regardless of whether the particular proceeding was against the person See Adv Comm Note to Fed Rules Crim Proc 11 e 6 Adv Comm Note to Fed Rules Evid 410 The same ambiguity inheres in the proposed version of Rule 12 2 e We should recommend that it be eliminated now To that extent I respectfully dissent Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1985 Amendment Note to Subdivision e This clarifying amendment is intended to serve the same purpose as a comparable change made in 1979 to similar language in Rule 11 e 6 The change makes it clear that evidence of a withdrawn intent is thereafter inadmissible against the person who gave the notice in any civil or criminal proceeding without regard to whether the proceeding is against that person Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment The amendments are technical No substantive change is intended Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 12 2 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only except as noted below The substantive changes to Rule 12 2 are designed to address five issues First the amendment clarifies that a court may order a mental examination for a defendant who has indicated an intention to raise a defense of mental condition bearing on the issue of guilt Second the defendant is required to give notice of an intent to present expert evidence of the defendant s mental condition during a capital sentencing proceeding Third the amendment addresses the ability of the trial court to order a mental examination for a defendant who has given notice of an intent to present evidence of mental condition during capital sentencing proceedings and when the results of that examination may be disclosed Fourth the amendment addresses the timing of disclosure of the results and reports of the defendant s expert examination Finally the amendment extends the sanctions for failure to comply with the rule s requirements to the punishment phase of a capital case Under current Rule 12 2 b a defendant who intends to offer expert testimony on the issue of his or her mental condition on the question of guilt must provide a pretrial notice of that intent The amendment extends that notice requirement to a defendant who intends to offer expert evidence testimonial or otherwise on his or her mental condition during a capital sentencing proceeding As several courts have recognized the better practice is to require pretrial notice of that intent so that any mental examinations can be conducted without unnecessarily delaying capital sentencing proceedings See e g United States v Beckford 962 F Supp 748 754 – 64 E D Va 1997 United States v Haworth 942 F Supp 1406 1409 D N M 1996 The amendment adopts that view Revised Rule 12 2 c 1 addresses and clarifies the authority of the court to order mental examinations for a defendant — to determine competency of a defendant to stand trial under 18 U S C § 4241 to determine the defendant s sanity at the time of the alleged offense under 18 U S C § 4242 or in those cases where the defendant intends to present expert testimony on his or her mental condition Rule 12 2 c 1 A reflects the traditional authority of the court to order competency examinations With regard to examinations to determine insanity at the time of the offense current Rule 12 2 c implies that the trial court may grant a government motion for a mental examination of a defendant who has indicated under Rule 12 2 a an intent to raise the defense of insanity But the corresponding statute 18 U S C § 4242 requires the court to order an examination if the defendant has provided notice of an intent to raise that defense and the government moves for the examination Revised Rule 12 2 c 1 B now conforms the rule to § 4242 Any examination conducted on the issue of the insanity defense would thus be conducted in accordance with the procedures set out in that statutory provision Revised Rule 12 2 c 1 B also addresses those cases where the defendant is not relying on an insanity defense but intends to offer expert testimony on the issue of mental condition While the authority of a trial court to order a mental examination of a defendant who has registered an intent to raise the insanity defense seems clear the authority under the rule to order an examination of a defendant who intends only to present expert testimony on his or her mental condition on the issue of guilt is not as clear Some courts have concluded that a court may order such an examination See e g United States v Stackpole 811 F 2d 689 697 1st Cir 1987 United States v Buchbinder 796 F 2d 910 915 1st Cir 1986 and United States v Halbert 712 F 2d 388 9th Cir 1983 In United States v Davis 93 F 3d 1286 6th Cir 1996 however the court in a detailed analysis of the issue concluded that the district court lacked the authority under the rule to order a mental examination of a defendant who had provided notice of an intent to offer evidence on a defense of diminished capacity The court noted first that the defendant could not be ordered to undergo commitment and examination under 18 U S C § 4242 because that provision relates to situations when the defendant intends to rely on the defense of insanity The court also rejected the argument that the examination could be ordered under Rule 12 2 c because this was in the words of the rule an appropriate case The court concluded however that the trial court had the inherent authority to order such an examination The amendment clarifies that the authority of a court to order a mental examination under Rule 12 2 c 1 B extends to those cases when the defendant has provided notice under Rule 12 2 b of an intent to present expert testimony on the defendant s mental condition either on the merits or at capital sentencing See e g United States v Hall 152 F 3d 381 5th Cir 1998 cert denied 119 S Ct 1767 1999 The amendment to Rule 12 2 c 1 is not intended to affect any statutory or inherent authority a court may have to order other mental examinations The amendment leaves to the court the determination of what procedures should be used for a court ordered examination on the defendant s mental condition apart from insanity As currently provided in the rule if the examination is being ordered in connection with the defendant s stated intent to present an insanity defense the procedures are dictated by 18 U S C § 4242 On the other hand if the examination is being ordered in conjunction with a stated intent to present expert testimony on the defendant s mental condition not amounting to a defense of insanity either at the guilt or sentencing phases no specific statutory counterpart is available Accordingly the court is given the discretion to specify the procedures to be used In so doing the court may certainly be informed by other provisions which address hearings on a defendant s mental condition See e g 18 U S C § 4241 et seq Additional changes address the question when the results of an examination ordered under Rule 12 2 b 2 may or must be disclosed The Supreme Court has recognized that use of a defendant s statements during a court ordered examination may compromise the defendant s right against self incrimination See Estelle v Smith 451 U S 454 1981 defendant s privilege against self incrimination violated when he was not advised of right to remain silent during court ordered examination and prosecution introduced statements during capital sentencing hearing But subsequent cases have indicated that the defendant waives the privilege if the defendant introduces expert testimony on his or her mental condition See e g Powell v Texas 492 U S 680 683 – 84 1989 Buchanan v Kentucky 483 U S 402 421 – 24 1987 Presnell v Zant 959 F 2d 1524 1533 11th Cir 1992 Williams v Lynaugh 809 F 2d 1063 1068 5th Cir 1987 United States v Madrid 673 F 2d 1114 1119 21 10th Cir 1982 That view is reflected in Rule 12 2 c which indicates that the statements of the defendant may be used against the defendant only after the defendant has introduced testimony on his or her mental condition What the current rule does not address is if and to what extent the prosecution may see the results of the examination which may include the defendant s statements when evidence of the defendant s mental condition is being presented solely at a capital sentencing proceeding The proposed change in Rule 12 2 c 2 adopts the procedure used by some courts to seal or otherwise insulate the results of the examination until it is clear that the defendant will introduce expert evidence about his or her mental condition at a capital sentencing hearing i e after a verdict of guilty on one or more capital crimes and a reaffirmation by the defendant of an intent to introduce expert mental condition evidence in the sentencing phase See e g United States v Beckford 962 F Supp 748 E D Va 1997 Most courts that have addressed the issue have recognized that if the government obtains early access to the accused s statements it will be required to show that it has not made any derivative use of that evidence Doing so can consume time and resources See e g United States v Hall supra 152 F 3d at 398 noting that sealing of record although not constitutionally required likely advances interests of judicial economy by avoiding litigation over [ derivative use issue ] Except as provided in Rule 12 2 c 3 the rule does not address the time for disclosing results and reports of any expert examination conducted by the defendant New Rule 12 2 c 3 provides that upon disclosure under subdivision c 2 of the results and reports of the government s examination disclosure of the results and reports of the defendant s expert examination is mandatory if the defendant intends to introduce expert evidence relating to the examination Rule 12 2 c as previously written restricted admissibility of the defendant s statements during the course of an examination conducted under the rule to an issue respecting mental condition on which the defendant has introduced testimony — expert or otherwise As amended Rule 12 2 c 4 provides that the admissibility of such evidence in a capital sentencing proceeding is triggered only by the defendant s introduction of expert evidence The Committee believed that in this context it was appropriate to limit the government s ability to use the results of its expert mental examination to instances in which the defendant has first introduced expert evidence on the issue Rule 12 2 d has been amended to extend sanctions for failure to comply with the rule to the penalty phase of a capital case The selection of an appropriate remedy for the failure of a defendant to provide notice or submit to an examination under subdivisions b and c is entrusted to the discretion of the court While subdivision d recognizes that the court may exclude the evidence of the defendant s own expert in such a situation the court should also consider the effectiveness of less severe sanctions the impact of preclusion on the evidence at trial and the outcome of the case the extent of prosecutorial surprise or prejudice and whether the violation was willful Taylor v Illinois 484 U S 400 414 n 19 1988 citing Fendler v Goldsmith 728 F 2d 1181 9th Cir 1983 Committee Notes on Rules — 2005 Amendment The amendment to Rule 12 2 d fills a gap created in the 2002 amendments to the rule The substantively amended rule that took effect December 1 2002 permits a sanction of exclusion of any expert evidence for failure to give notice or failure to submit to an examination but provides no sanction for failure to disclose reports The proposed amendment is designed to address that specific issue Rule 12 2 d 1 is a slightly restructured version of current Rule 12 2 d Rule 12 2 d 2 is new and permits the court to exclude any expert evidence for failure to comply with the disclosure requirement in Rule 12 2 c 3 The sanction is intended to relate only to the evidence related to the matters addressed in the report which the defense failed to disclose Unlike the broader sanction for the two violations listed in Rule 12 2 d 1 — which can substantially affect the entire hearing — the Committee believed that it would be overbroad to expressly authorize exclusion of any expert evidence even evidence unrelated to the results and reports that were not disclosed as required in Rule 12 2 c 3 The rule assumes that the sanction of exclusion will result only where there has been a complete failure to disclose the report If the report is disclosed albeit in an untimely fashion other relief may be appropriate for example granting a continuance to the government to review the report Changes Made After Publication

Witnesses 1 Notice in General If a defendant intends to assert a defense of actual or believed exercise of public authority on behalf of a law enforcement agency or federal intelligence agency at the time of the alleged offense the defendant must so notify an attorney for the government in writing and must file a copy of the notice with the clerk within the time provided for filing a pretrial motion or at any later time the court sets The notice filed with the clerk must be under seal if the notice identifies a federal intelligence agency as the source of public authority 2 Contents of Notice The notice must contain the following information A the law enforcement agency or federal intelligence agency involved B the agency member on whose behalf the defendant claims to have acted and C the time during which the defendant claims to have acted with public authority 3 Response to the Notice An attorney for the government must serve a written response on the defendant or the defendant s attorney within 14 days after receiving the defendant s notice but no later than 21 days before trial The response must admit or deny that the defendant exercised the public authority identified in the defendant s notice 4 Disclosing Witnesses A Government s Request An attorney for the government may request in writing that the defendant disclose the name address and telephone number of each witness the defendant intends to rely on to establish a public authority defense An attorney for the government may serve the request when the government serves its response to the defendant s notice under Rule 12 3 a 3 or later but must serve the request no later than 21 days before trial B Defendant s Response Within 14 days after receiving the government s request the defendant must serve on an attorney for the government a written statement of the name address and telephone number of each witness C Government s Reply Within 14 days after receiving the defendant s statement an attorney for the government must serve on the defendant or the defendant s attorney a written statement of the name of each witness — and the address and telephone number of each witness other than a victim — that the government intends to rely on to oppose the defendant s public authority defense D Victim s Address and Telephone Number If the government intends to rely on a victim s testimony to oppose the defendant s public authority defense and the defendant establishes a need for the victim s address and telephone number the court may i order the government to provide the information in writing to the defendant or the defendant s attorney or ii fashion a reasonable procedure that allows for preparing the defense and also protects the victim s interests 5 Additional Time The court may for good cause allow a party additional time to comply with this rule b Continuing Duty to Disclose 1 In General Both an attorney for the government and the defendant must promptly disclose in writing to the other party the name of any additional witness — and the address and telephone number of any additional witness other than a victim — if A the disclosing party learns of the witness before or during trial and B the witness should have been disclosed under Rule 12 3 a 4 if the disclosing party had known of the witness earlier 2 Address and Telephone Number of an Additional Victim Witness The address and telephone number of an additional victim witness must not be disclosed except as provided in Rule 12 3 a 4 D c Failure to Comply If a party fails to comply with this rule the court may exclude the testimony of any undisclosed witness regarding the public authority defense This rule does not limit the defendant s right to testify d Protective Procedures Unaffected This rule does not limit the court s authority to issue appropriate protective orders or to order that any filings be under seal e Inadmissibility of Withdrawn Intention Evidence of an intention as to which notice was given under Rule 12 3 a later withdrawn is not in any civil or criminal proceeding admissible against the person who gave notice of the intention Added Pub L 100 – 690 title VI § 6483 Nov 18 1988 102

Note to Rule 45 a Committee Notes on Rules — 2010 Amendment Subdivisions a and b The amendment implements the Crime Victims Rights Act which states that victims have the right to be reasonably protected from the accused and to be treated with respect for the victim s dignity and privacy See 18 U S C § 3771 a 1 & 8 The rule provides that a victim s address and telephone number should not automatically be provided to the defense when a public authority defense is raised If a defendant establishes a need for this information the court has discretion to order its disclosure or to fashion an alternative procedure that provides the defendant with the information necessary to prepare a defense but also protects the victim s interests In the case of victims who will testify concerning a public authority claim the same procedures and standards apply to both the prosecutor s initial disclosure and the prosecutor s continuing duty to disclose under subdivision b Changes Made to Proposed Amendment Released for Public Comment No changes were made after the amendment was released for public comment Rule 12 4 Disclosure Statement a Who Must File 1 Nongovernmental Corporate Party Any nongovernmental corporate party to a proceeding in a district court must file a statement that identifies any parent corporation and any publicly held corporation that owns 10 % or more of its stock or states that there is no such corporation 2 Organizational Victim If an organization is a victim of the alleged criminal activity the government must file a statement identifying the victim If the organizational victim is a corporation the statement must also disclose the information required by Rule 12 4 a 1 to the extent it can be obtained through due diligence b Time for Filing Supplemental Filing A party must 1 file the Rule 12 4 a statement upon the defendant s initial appearance and 2 promptly file a supplemental statement upon any change in the information that the statement requires Added Apr 29 2002 eff Dec 1 2002 Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Rule 12 4 is a new rule modeled after Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 26 1 and parallels similar provisions being proposed in new Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 7 1 The purpose of the rule is to assist judges in determining whether they must recuse themselves because of a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 3C 1 c 1972 It does not however deal with other circumstances that might lead to disqualification for other reasons Under Rule 12 4 a 1 any nongovernmental corporate party must file a statement that indicates whether it has any parent corporation that owns 10 % or more of its stock or indicates that there is no such corporation Although the term nongovernmental corporate party will almost always involve organizational defendants it might also cover any third party that asserts an interest in property to be forfeited under new Rule 32 2 Rule 12 4 a 2 requires an attorney for the government to file a statement that lists any organizational victims of the alleged criminal activity the purpose of this disclosure is to alert the court to the fact that a possible ground for disqualification might exist Further if the organizational victim is a corporation the statement must include the same information required of any nongovernmental corporate party The rule requires an attorney for the government to use due diligence in obtaining that information from a corporate organizational victim recognizing that the timing requirements of Rule 12 4 b might make it difficult to obtain the necessary information by the time the initial appearance is conducted Although the disclosures required by Rule 12 4 may seem limited they are calculated to reach the majority of circumstances that are likely to call for disqualification on the basis of information that a judge may not know or recollect Framing a rule that calls for more detailed disclosure is problematic and will inevitably require more information than is necessary for purposes of automatic recusal Unnecessary disclosure of volumes of information may create the risk that a judge will overlook the one bit of information that might require disqualification and may also create the risk that courts will experience unnecessary disqualifications rather than attempt to unravel a potentially difficult question The same concerns about overbreadth are potentially present in any local rules that might address this topic Rule 12 4 does not address the promulgation of any local rules that might address the same issue or supplement the requirements of the rule The rule does not cover disclosure of all financial information that could be relevant to a judge s decision whether to recuse himself or herself from a case The Committee believes that with the various disclosure practices in the federal courts and with the development of technology more comprehensive disclosure may be desirable and feasible Rule 12 4 b 1 indicates that the time for filing the disclosure statement is at the point when the defendant enters an initial appearance under Rule 5 Although there may be other instances where an earlier appearance of a party in a civil proceeding would raise concerns about whether the presiding judicial officer should be notified of a possible grounds for recusal the Committee believed that in criminal cases the most likely time for that to occur is at the initial appearance and that it was important to set a uniform triggering event for disclosures under this rule Finally Rule 12 4 b 2 requires the parties to file supplemental statements with the court if there are any changes in the information required in the statement Rule 13 Joint Trial of Separate Cases The court may order that separate cases be tried together as though brought in a single indictment or information if all offenses and all defendants could have been joined in a single indictment or information As amended Apr 29 2002 eff Dec 1 2002 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1944 This rule is substantially a restatement of existing law 18 U S C [ former ] 557 Indictments and

of offenses or defendants in an indictment an information or a consolidation for trial appears to prejudice a defendant or the government the court may order separate trials of counts sever the defendants trials or provide any other relief that justice requires b Defendant s Statements Before ruling on a defendant s motion to sever the court may order an attorney for the government to

Advisory Committee on Rules — 1966 Amendment A defendant may be prejudiced by the admission in evidence against a co defendant of a statement or confession made by that co defendant This prejudice cannot be dispelled by cross examination if the co defendant does not take the stand Limiting instructions to the jury may not in fact erase the prejudice While the question whether to grant a severance is generally left within the discretion of the trial court recent Fifth Circuit cases have found sufficient prejudice involved to make denial of a motion for severance reversible error See Schaffer v United States 221 F 2d 17 5th Cir 1955 Barton v United States 263 F 2d 894 5th Cir 1959 It has even been suggested that when the confession of the co defendant comes as a surprise at the trial it may be error to deny a motion or a mistrial See Belvin v United States 273 F 2d 583 5th Cir 1960 The purpose of the amendment is to provide a procedure whereby the issue of possible prejudice can be resolved on the motion for severance The judge may direct the disclosure of the confessions or statements of the defendants to him for in camera inspection as an aid to determining whether the possible prejudice justifies ordering separate trials Cf note Joint and Single Trials Under Rules 8 and 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 74 Yale L J 551 565 1965 Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 14 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only The reference to a defendant s confession in the last sentence of the current rule has been deleted The Committee believed that the reference to the defendant s statements in the amended rule would fairly embrace any confessions or admissions by a defendant Rule 15 Depositions a When Taken 1 In General A party may move that a prospective witness be deposed in order to preserve testimony for trial The court may grant the motion because of exceptional circumstances and in the interest of justice If the court orders the deposition to be taken it may also require the deponent to produce at the deposition any designated material that is not privileged including any book paper document record recording or data 2 Detained Material Witness A witness who is detained under 18 U S C § 3144 may request to be deposed by filing a written motion and giving notice to the parties The court may then order that the deposition be taken and may discharge the witness after the witness has signed under oath the deposition transcript b Notice 1 In General A party seeking to take a deposition must give every other party reasonable written notice of the deposition s date and location The notice must state the name and address of each deponent If requested by a party receiving the notice the court may for good cause change the deposition s date or location 2 To the Custodial Officer A party seeking to take the deposition must also notify the officer who has custody of the defendant of the scheduled date and location c Defendant s Presence 1 Defendant in Custody Except as authorized by Rule 15 c 3 the officer who has custody of the defendant must produce the defendant at the deposition and keep the defendant in the witness s presence during the examination unless the defendant A waives in writing the right to be present or B persists in disruptive conduct justifying exclusion after being warned by the court that disruptive conduct will result in the defendant s exclusion 2 Defendant Not in Custody Except as authorized by Rule 15 c 3 a defendant who is not in custody has the right upon request to be present at the deposition subject to any conditions imposed by the court If the government tenders the defendant s expenses as provided in Rule 15 d but the defendant still fails to appear the defendant — absent good cause — waives both the right to appear and any objection to the taking and use of the deposition based on that right 3 Taking Depositions Outside the United States Without the Defendant s Presence The deposition of a witness who is outside the United States may be taken without the defendant s presence if the court makes case specific findings of all the following A the witness s testimony could provide substantial proof of a material fact in a felony prosecution B there is a substantial likelihood that the witness s attendance at trial cannot be obtained C the witness s presence for a deposition in the United States cannot be obtained D the defendant cannot be present because i the country where the witness is located will not permit the defendant to attend the deposition ii for an in custody defendant secure transportation and continuing custody cannot be assured at the witness s location or iii for an out of custody defendant no reasonable conditions will assure an appearance at the deposition or at trial or sentencing and E the defendant can meaningfully participate in the deposition through reasonable means d Expenses If the deposition was requested by the government the court may — or if the defendant is unable to bear the deposition expenses the court must — order the government to pay 1 any reasonable travel and subsistence expenses of the defendant and the defendant s attorney to attend the deposition and 2 the costs of the deposition transcript e Manner of Taking Unless these rules or a court order provides otherwise a deposition must be taken and filed in the same manner as a deposition in a civil action except that 1 A defendant may not be deposed without that defendant s consent 2 The scope and manner of the deposition examination and cross examination must be the same as would be allowed during trial 3 The government must provide to the defendant or the defendant s attorney for use at the deposition any statement of the deponent in the government s possession to which the defendant would be entitled at trial f Admissibility and Use as Evidence An order authorizing a deposition to be taken under this rule does not determine its admissibility A party may use all or part of a deposition as provided by the Federal Rules of Evidence g Objections A party objecting to deposition testimony or evidence must state the grounds for the objection during the deposition h Depositions by Agreement Permitted The parties may by agreement take and use a deposition with the court s consent As amended Apr 22 1974 eff Dec 1 1975 Pub L 94 – 64 § 3 15 – 19 July 31 1975 89 Stat 373 374 Pub L 98 – 473 title II § 209 b Oct 12 1984 98 Stat 1986 Mar 9 1987 eff Aug 1 1987 Apr 29 2002 eff

limited classes of cases under dedimus potestatem and in perpetuam rei memoriam 28 U S C [ former ] 644 This statute has been generally held applicable to criminal cases Clymer v United States 38 F 2d

United States 45 F 2d 497 C C A 4th — cert den 283 U S 820 The rule continues the limitation of the statute that the taking of depositions is to be restricted to cases in which they are necessary in order to prevent a failure of justice 2 Unlike the practice in civil cases in which depositions may be taken as a matter of right by notice without permission of the court Rules 26 a and 30 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [ 28 U S C Appendix ] this rule permits depositions to be taken only by order of the court made in the exercise of discretion and on notice to all parties It was contemplated that in criminal cases depositions would be used only in exceptional situations as has been the practice heretofore 3 This rule introduces a new feature in authorizing the taking of the deposition of a witness committed for failure to give bail see Rule 46 b This matter is however left to the discretion of the court The purpose of the rule is to afford a method of relief for such a witness if the court finds it proper to extend it Note to Subdivision b This subdivision as well as subdivisions d and f sets forth the procedure to be followed in the event that the court grants an order for the taking of a deposition The procedure prescribed is similar to that in civil cases Rules 28 – 31 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [ 28 U S C Appendix ] Note to Subdivision c This rule introduces a new feature for the purpose of protecting the rights of an indigent defendant Note to Subdivision d See Note to Subdivision b supra Note to Subdivision e In providing when and for what purpose a deposition may be used at the trial this rule generally follows the corresponding provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 26 d 3 [ 28 U S C Appendix ] The only difference is that in civil cases a deposition may be introduced at the trial if the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of trial while this rule requires that the witness be out of the United States The distinction results from the fact that a subpoena in a civil case runs only within the district where issued or 100 miles from the place of trial Rule 45 e 1 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure while a subpoena in a criminal case runs throughout the United States see Rule 17 e 1 infra Note to Subdivision f See Note to Subdivision b supra Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1974 Amendment Rule 15 authorizes the taking of depositions by the government Under former rule 15 only a defendant was authorized to take a deposition The revision is similar to Title VI of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 The principal difference is that Title VI 18 U S C § 3503 limits the authority of the government to take depositions to cases in which the Attorney General certifies that the proceeding is against a person who is believed to have participated in an organized criminal activity This limitation is not contained in rule 15 Dealing with the issue of government depositions so soon after the enactment of 18 U S C § 3503 is not inconsistent with the congressional purpose On the floor of the House Congressman Poff a principal spokesman for the proposal said that the House version was not designed to limit the Judicial Conference of the United States in the exercise of its rulemaking authority from addressing itself to other problems in this area or from adopting a broader approach 116 Cong Rec 35293 1970 The recently enacted Title VI of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 18 U S C § 3503 is based upon earlier efforts of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules which has over the past twenty five years submitted several proposals authorizing government depositions The earlier drafts of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure proposed that the government be allowed to take depositions Orfield The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 33 Calif L Rev 543 559 1945 The Fifth Draft of what became rule 15 then rule 20 dated June 1942 was submitted to the Supreme Court for comment The court had a number of unfavorable comments about allowing government depositions These comments were not published The only reference to the fact that the court made comments is in 2 Orfield Criminal Procedure under the Federal Rules § 15 1 1966 and Orfield Depositions in Federal Criminal Procedure 9 S C L Q 376 380 – 381 1957 The Advisory Committee in the 1940 s continued to recommend the adoption of a provision authorizing government depositions The final draft submitted to the Supreme Court contained a section providing The following additional requirements shall apply if the deposition is taken at the instance of the government or of a witness The officer having custody of a defendant shall be notified of the time and place set for examination and shall produce him at the examination and keep him in the presence of the witness during the examination A defendant not in custody shall be given notice and shall have the right to be present at the examination The government shall pay in advance to the defendant s attorney and a defendant not in custody expenses of travel and subsistence for attendance at the examination See 2 Orfield Criminal Procedure under the Federal Rules § 15 3 pp 447 – 448 1966 Orfield Depositions in Federal Criminal Procedure 9 S C L Q 376 383 1957 The Supreme Court rejected this section in this entirety thus eliminating the provision for depositions by the government These changes were made without comment The proposal to allow government depositions was renewed in the amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in the early 1960 s The Preliminary Draft of Proposed Amendments to Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts December 1962 proposed to amend rule 15 by eliminating the words of a defendant from the first sentence of subdivision a and adding a subdivision g which was practically identical to the subdivision rejected by the Supreme Court in the original draft of the rules The Second Preliminary Draft of Proposed Amendments to Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts March 1964 continued to propose allowing governments depositions Subdivision g was substantially modified however The following additional requirements shall apply if the deposition is taken at the instance of the government or a witness Both the defendant and his attorney shall be given reasonable advance notice of the time and place set for the examination The officer having custody of a defendant shall be notified of the time and place set for the examination and shall produce him at the examination and keep him in the presence of the witness during the examination A defendant not in custody shall have the right to be present at the examination but his failure to appear after notice and tender of expenses shall constitute a waiver of that right The government shall pay to the defendant s attorney and to a defendant not in custody expenses of travel and subsistence for attendance at the examination The government shall make available to the defendant for his examination and use at the taking of the deposition any statement of the witness being deposed which is in the possession of the government and which the government would be required to make available to the defendant if the witness were testifying at the trial The proposal to authorize government depositions was rejected by the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure § 241 at 477 1969 4 Barron Federal Practice and Procedure Supp 1967 The Report of the Judicial Conference submitted to the Supreme Court for approval late in 1965 contained no proposal for an amendment to rule 15 See 39 F R D 69 168 – 211 1966 When the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 was originally introduced in the Senate S 30 it contained a government deposition provision which was similar to the 1964 proposal of the Criminal Rules Advisory Committee except that the original bill S 30 failed to provide standards to control the use of depositions at the trial For an explanation and defense of the original proposal see McClellan The Organized Crime Act S 30 or Its Critics Which Threatens Civil Liberties 46 Notre Dame Lawyer 55 100 – 108 1970 This omission was remedied prior to passage with the addition of what is now 18 U S C § 3503 f which prescribes the circumstances in which a deposition can be used The standards are the same as those in former rule 15 e with the addition of language allowing the use of the deposition when the witness refuses in the trial or hearing to testify concerning the subject of the deposition or the part offered Before the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 was enacted an additional amendment was added providing that the right of the government to take a deposition is limited to cases in which the Attorney General certifies that the defendant is believed to have participated in an organized criminal activity [ 18 U S C § 3503 a ] The argument in favor of the amendment was that the whole purpose of the act was to deal with organized crime and therefore its provisions including that providing for government depositions should be limited to organized crime type cases There is another aspect of Advisory Committee history which is relevant In January 1970 the Advisory Committee circulated proposed changes in rule 16 one of which gives the government when it has disclosed the identity of its witnesses the right to take a deposition and use it in the event the witness has become unavailable without the fault of the government or if the witness has changed his testimony [ See Preliminary Draft of Proposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts rule 16 a 1 vi January 1970 ] This provision is now incorporated within rule 16 a 1 v Because neither the court nor the standing committee gave reasons for rejecting the government deposition proposal it is not possible to know why they were not approved To the extent that the rejection was based upon doubts as to the constitutionality of such a proposal those doubts now seem resolved by California v Green 399 U S 149 90 S Ct 1930 26 L Ed 2d 489 1970 On the merits the proposal to allow the government to take depositions is consistent with the revision of rule 16 and with section 804 b 1 of the Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and Magistrates November 1971 which provides that the following is not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable 1 Former Testimony Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of another proceeding at the instance of or against a party with an opportunity to develop the testimony by direct cross or redirect examination with motive and interest similar to those of the party against whom now offered Subdivision a is revised to provide that the government as well as the defendant is entitled to take a deposition The phrase whenever due to special circumstances of the case it is in the interest of justice is intended to make clear that the decision by the court as to whether to order the taking of a deposition shall be made in the context of the circumstances of the particular case The principal objective is the preservation of evidence for use at trial It is not to provide a method of pretrial discovery nor primarily for the purpose of obtaining a basis for later cross examination of an adverse witness Discovery is a matter dealt with in rule 16 An obviously important factor is whether a deposition will expedite rather than delay the administration of criminal justice Also important is the presence or absence of factors which determine the use of a deposition at the trial such as the agreement of the parties to use of the deposition the possible unavailability of the witness or the possibility that coercion may be used upon the witness to induce him to change his testimony or not to testify See rule 16 a 1 v Subdivision a also makes explicit that only the testimony of a prospective witness of a party can be taken This means the party s own witness and does not authorize a discovery deposition of an adverse witness The language for use at trial is intended to give further emphasis to the importance of the criteria for use specified in subdivision e In subdivision b reference is made to the defendant in custody If he is in state custody a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum to produce the prisoner for purposes of testimony may be required to accomplish his presence In subdivision d the language except as otherwise provided in these rules is meant to make clear that the subpoena provisions of rule 17 control rather than the provisions of the civil rules The use of the phrase and manner in subdivision d 2 is intended to emphasize that the authorization is not to conduct an adverse examination of an opposing witness In subdivision e the phrase as substantive evidence is added to make clear that the deposition can be used as evidence in chief as well as for purposes of impeachment Subdivision e also makes clear that the deposition can be used as affirmative evidence whenever the witness is available but gives testimony inconsistent with that given in the deposition A California statute which contained a similar provision was held constitutional in California v Green 399 U S 149 90 S Ct 1930 26 L Ed 2d 489 1970 This is also consistent with section 801 d 1 of the Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates Nov 1971 Subdivision f is intended to insure that a record of objections and the grounds for the objections is made at the time the deposition is taken when the witness is available so that the witness can be examined further if necessary on the point of the objection so that there will be an adequate record for the court s later ruling upon the objection Subdivision g uses the unavailability definition of the Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and Magistrates 804 a Nov 1971 Subdivision h is intended to make clear that the court always has authority to order the taking of a deposition or to allow the use of a deposition where there is an agreement of the parties to the taking or to the use Notes of Committee on the Judiciary House Report No 94 – 247 1975 Amendment A Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Criminal

that a the prospective witness will be unable to attend or be prevented from attending the trial b the prospective witness testimony is material and c the prospective witness testimony is necessary to prevent a failure of justice The Supreme Court promulgated several amendments to Rule 15 The more significant amendments are described below Subdivision a as proposed to be amended permits either party to move the court for the taking of a deposition of a witness However a party may only move to take the deposition of one of its own witnesses not one of the adversary party s witnesses Subdivision c as proposed to be amended provides that whenever a deposition is taken at the instance of the government or of an indigent defendant the expenses of the taking of the deposition must be paid by the government Subdivision e as proposed to be amended provides that part or all of the deposition may be used at trial as substantive evidence if the witness is unavailable or if the witness gives testimony inconsistent with his deposition Subdivision b [ g ] as proposed to be amended defines unavailable Unavailable as a witness includes situations in which the deponent 1 is exempted by ruling of the judge on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of his deposition or 2 persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of his deposition despite an order of the judge to do so or 3 testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of his deposition or 4 is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity or 5 is absent from the hearing and the proponent of his deposition has been unable to procure his attendance by process or other reasonable means A deponent is not unavailable as a witness if his exemption refusal claim of lack of memory inability or absence is due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of his deposition for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying B Committee Action The Committee narrowed the definition of unavailability in subdivision g The Committee deleted language from that subdivision that provided that a witness was unavailable if the court exempts him from testifying at the trial on the ground of privilege The Committee does not want to encourage the use of depositions at trial especially in view of the importance of having live testimony from a witness on the witness stand The Committee added a provision to subdivision b to parallel the provision of Rule 43 b 2 This is to make it clear that a disruptive defendant may be removed from the place where a deposition is being taken The Committee added language to subdivision c to make clear that the government must pay for the cost of the transcript of a deposition when the deposition is taken at the instance of an indigent defendant or of the government In order to use a deposition at trial it must be transcribed The proposed rule did not explicitly provide for payment of the cost of transcribing and the Committee change rectifies this The Committee notes that subdivision e permits the use of a deposition when the witness gives testimony at the trial or hearing inconsistent with his deposition Since subdivision e refers to the rules of evidence the Committee understands that the Federal Rules of Evidence will govern the admissibility and use of the deposition The Committee by adopting subdivision e as proposed to be amended by the Supreme Court intends the Federal Rules of Evidence to govern the admissibility and use of the deposition The Committee believes that Rule 15 will not encourage trials by deposition A deposition may be taken only in exceptional circumstances when it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of a prospective witness of a party be taken and preserved * * * A deposition once it is taken is not automatically admissible at trial however It may only be used at trial if the witness is unavailable and the rule narrowly defines unavailability The procedure established in Rule 15 is similar to the procedure established by the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 for the taking and use of depositions in organized crime cases See 18 U S C 3503 Conference Committee Notes House Report No 94 – 414 1975 Amendment Rule 15 deals with the taking of depositions and the use of depositions at trial Rule 15 e permits a deposition to be used if the witness is unavailable Rule 15 g defines that term The Supreme Court s proposal defines five circumstances in which the witness will be considered unavailable The House version of the bill deletes a provision that said a witness is unavailable if he is exempted at trial on the ground of privilege from testifying about the subject matter of his deposition The Senate version of the bill by cross reference to the Federal Rules of Evidence restores the Supreme Court proposal The Conference adopts the Senate provision Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment The amendments are technical No substantive change is intended Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 15 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only except as noted below In Rule 15 a the list of materials to be produced has been amended to include the expansive term data to reflect the fact that in an increasingly technological culture the information may exist in a format not already covered by the more conventional list such as a book or document The last portion of current Rule 15 b dealing with the defendant s presence at a deposition has been moved to amended Rule 15 c Revised Rule 15 d addresses the payment of expenses incurred by the defendant and the defendant s attorney Under the current rule if the government requests the deposition or if the defendant requests the deposition and is unable to pay for it the court may direct the government to pay for travel and subsistence expenses for both the defendant and the defendant s attorney In either case the current rule requires the government to pay for the transcript Under the amended rule if the government requested the deposition the court must require the government to pay reasonable subsistence and travel expenses and the cost of the deposition transcript If the defendant is unable to pay the deposition expenses the court must order the government to pay reasonable subsistence and travel expenses and the deposition transcript costs — regardless of who requested the deposition Although the current rule places no apparent limits on the amount of funds that should be reimbursed the Committee believed that insertion of the word reasonable was consistent with current practice Rule 15 f is intended to more clearly reflect that the admissibility of any deposition taken under the rule is governed not by the rule itself but instead by the Federal Rules of Evidence Committee Notes on Rules — 2012 Amendment Subdivisions c 3 and f This amendment provides a mechanism for taking depositions in cases in which important witnesses — government and defense witnesses both — live in or have fled to countries where they cannot be reached by the court s subpoena power Although Rule 15 authorizes depositions of witnesses in certain circumstances the rule to date has not addressed instances where an important witness is not in the United States there is a substantial likelihood the witness s attendance at trial cannot be obtained and it would not be possible to securely transport the defendant or a co defendant to the witness s location for a deposition While a party invokes Rule 15 in order to preserve testimony for trial the rule does not determine whether the resulting deposition will be admissible in whole or in part Subdivision f provides that in the case of all depositions questions of admissibility of the evidence obtained are left to the courts to resolve on a case by case basis Under Rule 15 f the courts make this determination applying the Federal Rules of Evidence which state that relevant evidence is admissible except as otherwise provided by the Constitution statutes the Rules of Evidence and other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court Fed R Evid 402 Rule 15 c as amended imposes significant procedural limitations on taking certain depositions in criminal cases The amended rule authorizes a deposition outside a defendant s physical presence only in very limited circumstances after the trial court makes case specific findings Amended Rule 15 c 3 delineates these circumstances and the specific findings a trial court must make before permitting parties to depose a witness outside the defendant s presence The party requesting the deposition shoulders the burden of proof — by a preponderance of the evidence — on the elements that must be shown The amended rule recognizes the important witness confrontation principles and vital law enforcement and other public interests that are involved This amendment does not supersede the relevant provisions of 18 U S C § 3509 authorizing depositions outside the defendant s physical presence in certain cases involving child victims and witnesses or any other provision of law Changes Made to Proposed Amendment Released for Public Comment The limiting phrase in the United States was deleted from Rule 15 c 1 and 2 and replaced with the phrase Except as authorized by Rule 15 c 3 The revised language makes clear that foreign depositions under the authority of c 3 are exceptions to the provisions requiring the defendant s presence but other depositions outside the United States remain subject to the general requirements of c 1 and 2 For example a defendant may waive his right to be present at a foreign deposition and a defendant who attends a foreign deposition may be removed from such a deposition if he is disruptive In subdivision c 3 D the introductory phrase was revised to the simpler because In order to restrict foreign depositions outside of the defendant s presence to situations where the deposition serves an important public interest the limiting phrase in a felony prosecution was added to subdivision c 3 A The text of subdivision f and the Committee Note were revised to state more clearly the limited purpose and effect of the amendment which is providing assistance in pretrial discovery Compliance with the procedural requirements for the taking of the foreign testimony does not predetermine admissibility at trial which is determined on a case by case basis applying the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Constitution Other changes were also made in the Committee Note In conformity with the style conventions governing the rules citations to cases were deleted and other changes were made to improve clarity References in Text The Federal Rules of Evidence referred to in subd f are set out in the Appendix to Title 28 Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Amendment by Public

testimony that the government intends to use under Rules 702 703 or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence during its case in chief at trial If the government requests discovery under subdivision b 1 C ii and the defendant complies the government must at the defendant s request give to the defendant a written summary of testimony that the government intends to use under Rules 702 703 or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence as evidence at trial on the issue of the defendant s mental condition The summary provided under this subparagraph must describe the witness s opinions the bases and reasons for those opinions and the witness s qualifications 2 Information Not Subject to Disclosure Except as permitted by Rule 16 a 1 A – D F and G this rule does not authorize the discovery or inspection of reports memoranda or other internal government documents made by an attorney for the government or other government agent in connection with investigating or prosecuting the case Nor does this rule authorize the discovery or inspection of statements made by prospective government witnesses except as provided in 18 U S C § 3500 3 Grand Jury Transcripts This rule does not apply to the discovery or inspection of a grand jury s recorded proceedings except as provided in Rules 6 12 h 16 a 1 and 26 2 b Defendant s Disclosure 1 Information Subject to Disclosure A Documents and Objects If a defendant

s possession custody or control and ii the defendant intends to use the item in the defendant s case in chief at trial or intends to call the witness who prepared the report and the report relates to the witness s testimony C Expert Witnesses The defendant must at the government s request give to the government a written summary of any testimony that the defendant intends to use under Rules 702 703 or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence as evidence at trial if — i the defendant requests disclosure under subdivision a 1 G and the government complies or ii the defendant has given notice under Rule 12 2 b of an intent to present expert testimony on the defendant s mental condition This summary must describe the witness s opinions the bases and reasons for those opinions and the witness s

by the defendant or the defendant s attorney or agent during the case s investigation or defense or B a statement made to the defendant or the defendant s attorney or agent by i the defendant ii a government or defense witness or iii a prospective government or defense witness c Continuing Duty to Disclose A party who discovers additional evidence or material before or during trial must promptly disclose its existence to the other party or the court if 1 the evidence or material is subject to discovery or inspection under this rule and 2 the other party previously requested or the

The rule is a restatement of this procedure In addition it permits the procedure to be invoked in cases of objects and documents obtained from others by seizure or by process on the theory that such evidential matter would probably have been accessible to the defendant if it had not previously been seized by the prosecution The entire matter is left within the discretion of the court Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1966 Amendment The extent to which pretrial discovery should be permitted in criminal cases is a complex and controversial issue The problems have been explored in detail

discovery At the same time provisions are made to guard against possible abuses Subdivision a — The court is authorized to order the attorney for the government to permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph three different types of material 1 Relevant written or recorded statements or confessions made by the defendant or copies thereof The defendant is not required to designate because he may not always be aware that his statements or confessions are being recorded The government s obligation is limited to production of such statements as are within the possession custody or control of the government the existence of which is known or by the exercise of due diligence may become known to the attorney for the government Discovery of statements and confessions is in line with what the Supreme Court has described as the better practice Cicenia v LaGay 357 U S 504 511 1958 and with the law in a number of states See e g Del Rules Crim Proc Rule 16 Ill Stat Ch 38 § 729 Md Rules Proc Rule 728 State v McGee 91 Ariz 101 370 P 2d 261 1962 Cash v Superior Court 53 Cal 2d 72 346 P 2d 407 1959 State v Bickham 239 La 1094 121 So 2d 207 cert den 364 U S 874 1960 People v Johnson 356

written statements For state cases upholding the discovery of recordings see e g People v Cartier 51 Cal 2d 590 335 P 2d 114 1959 State v Minor 177 A 2d 215 Del Super Ct 1962 2 Relevant results or reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments including fingerprint and handwriting comparisons made in connection with the particular case or copies thereof Again the defendant is not required to designate but the government s obligation is limited to production of items within the possession custody or control of the government the existence of which is known or by the exercise of due diligence may become known to the attorney for the government With respect to results or reports of scientific tests or experiments the range of materials which must be produced by the government is further limited to those made in connection with the particular case Cf Fla Stats § 909 18 State v Superior Court 90 Ariz 133 367 P 2d 6 1961 People v Cooper 53 Cal 2d 755 770 3 Cal Rptr 148 157 349 P 2d 1964 973 1960 People v Stokes supra at 762 204 N Y Supp 2d at 835 3 Relevant recorded testimony of a defendant before a grand jury The policy which favors pretrial disclosure to a defendant of his statements to government agents also supports pretrial disclosure of his testimony before a grand jury Courts however have tended to require a showing of special circumstances before ordering such disclosure See e g United States v Johnson 215 F Supp 300 D Md 1963 Disclosure is required only where the statement has been recorded and hence can be transcribed Subdivision b — This subdivision authorizes the court to order the attorney for the government to permit the defendant to inspect the copy or photograph all other books papers documents tangible objects buildings or places or copies or portions thereof which are within the possession custody or control of the government Because of the necessarily broad and general terms in which the items to be discovered are described several limitations are imposed 1 While specific designation is not required of the defendant the burden is placed on him to make a showing of materiality to the preparation of his defense and that his request is reasonable The requirement of reasonableness will permit the court to define and limit the scope of the government s obligation to search its files while meeting the legitimate needs of the defendant The court is also authorized to limit discovery to portions of items sought 2 Reports memoranda and other internal government documents made by government agents in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case are exempt from discovery Cf Palermo v United States 360 U S 343 1959 Ogden v United States 303 F 2d 724 9th Cir 1962 3 Except as provided for reports of examinations and tests in subdivision a 2 statements made by government witnesses or prospective government witnesses to agents of the government are also exempt from discovery except as provided by 18 U S C § 3500 Subdivision c — This subdivision permits the court to condition a discovery order under subdivision a 2 and subdivision b by requiring the defendant to permit the government to discover similar items which the defendant intends to produce at the trial and which are within his possession custody or control under restrictions similar to those placed in subdivision b upon discovery by the defendant While the government normally has resources adequate to secure the information necessary for trial there are some situations in which mutual disclosure would appear necessary to prevent the defendant from obtaining an unfair advantage For example in cases where both prosecution and defense have employed experts to make psychiatric examinations it seems as important for the government to study the opinions of the experts to be called by the defendant in order to prepare for trial as it does for the defendant to study those of the government s witnesses Or in cases such as antitrust cases in which the defendant is well represented and well financed mutual disclosure so far as consistent with the privilege against self incrimination would seem as appropriate as in civil cases State cases have indicated that a requirement that the defendant disclose in advance of trial materials which he intends to use on his own behalf at the trial is not a violation of the privilege against self incrimination See Jones v Superior Court 58 Cal 2d 56 22 Cal Rptr 879 372 P 2d 919 1962 People v Lopez 60 Cal 2d 223 32 Cal Rptr

76 Harv L Rev 828 1963 Subdivision d — This subdivision is substantially the same as the last sentence of the existing rule Subdivision e — This subdivision gives the court authority to deny restrict or defer discovery upon a sufficient showing Control of the abuses of discovery is necessary if it is to be expanded in the fashion proposed in subdivisions a and b Among the considerations to be taken into account by the court will be the safety of witnesses and others a particular danger of perjury or witness intimidation the protection of information vital to the national security and the protection of business enterprises from economic reprisals For an example of a use of a protective order in state practice see People v Lopez 60 Cal 2d 223 32 Cal Rptr 424 384 P 2d 16 1963 See also Brennan Remarks on Discovery 33 F R D 56 65 1963 Traynor Ground Lost and Found in Criminal Discovery 39 N Y U L Rev 228 244 250 In some cases it would defeat the purpose of the protective order if the government were required to make its showing in open court The problem arises in its most extreme form where matters of national security are involved Hence a procedure is set out where upon motion by the government the court may permit the government to make its showing in whole or in part in a written statement to be inspected by the court in camera If the court grants relief based on such showing the government s statement is to be sealed and preserved in the records of the court to be made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal by the defendant Cf 18 U S C § 3500 Subdivision f — This subdivision is designed to encourage promptness in making discovery motions and to give the court sufficient control to prevent unnecessary delay and court time consequent upon a multiplication of discovery motions Normally one motion should encompass all relief sought and a subsequent motion permitted only upon a showing of cause Where pretrial hearings are used pursuant to Rule 17 1 discovery issues may be resolved at such hearings Subdivision g — The first sentence establishes a continuing obligation on a party subject to a discovery order with respect to material discovered after initial compliance The duty provided is to notify the other party his attorney or the court of the existence of the material A motion can then be made by the other party for additional discovery and where the existence of the material is disclosed shortly before or during the trial for any necessary continuance The second sentence gives wide discretion to the court in dealing with the failure of either party to comply with a discovery order Such discretion will permit the court to consider the reasons why disclosure was not made the extent of the prejudice if any to the opposing party the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance and any other relevant circumstances Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1974 Amendment Rule 16 is revised to give greater discovery to both the prosecution and the defense Subdivision a deals with disclosure of evidence by the government Subdivision b deals with disclosure of evidence by the defendant The majority of the Advisory Committee is of the view that the two — prosecution and defense discovery — are related and that the giving of a broader right of discovery to the defense is dependent upon giving also a broader right of discovery to the prosecution The draft provides for a right of prosecution discovery independent of any prior request for discovery by the defendant The Advisory Committee is of the view that this is the most desirable approach to prosecution discovery See American Bar Association Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial pp 7 43 – 46 Approved Draft 1970 The language of the rule is recast from the court may order or the court shall order to the government shall permit or the defendant shall permit This is to make clear that discovery should be accomplished by the parties themselves without the necessity of a court order unless there is dispute as to whether the matter is discoverable or a request for a protective order under subdivision d 1 The court however has the inherent right to enter an order under this rule The rule is intended to prescribe the minimum amount of discovery to which the parties are entitled It is not intended to limit the judge s discretion to order broader discovery in appropriate cases For example subdivision a 3 is not intended to deny a judge s discretion to order disclosure of grand jury minutes where circumstances make it appropriate to do so Subdivision a 1 A amends the old rule to provide upon request of the defendant the government shall permit discovery if the conditions specified in subdivision a 1 A exist Some courts have construed the current language as giving the court discretion as to whether to grant discovery of defendant s statements See United States v Kaminsky 275 F Supp 365 S D N Y 1967 denying discovery because the defendant did not demonstrate that his request for discovery was warranted United States v Diliberto 264 F Supp 181 S D N Y 1967 holding that there must be a showing of actual need before discovery would be granted United States v Louis Carreau Inc 42 F R D 408 S D N Y 1967 holding that in the absence of a showing of good cause the government cannot be required to disclose defendant s prior statements in advance of trial In United States v Louis Carreau Inc at p 412 the court stated that if rule 16 meant that production of the statements was mandatory the word shall would have been used instead of may See also United States v Wallace 272 F Supp 838 S D N Y 1967 United States v Wood 270 F Supp 963 S D N Y 1967 United States v Leighton

1968 Other courts have held that even though the current rules make discovery discretionary the defendant need not show cause when he seeks to discover his own statements See United States v Aadal 280 F Supp 859 S D N Y 1967 United States v Federmann 41 F R D 339 S D N Y 1967 and United States v Projansky 44 F R D 550 S D N Y 1968 The amendment making disclosure mandatory under the circumstances prescribed in subdivision a 1 A resolves such ambiguity as may currently exist in the direction of more liberal discovery See C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure Criminal § 253 1969 Supp 1971

contributes to the fair and efficient administration of criminal justice by providing the defendant with enough information to make an informed decision as to plea by minimizing the undesirable effect of surprise at the trial and by otherwise contributing to an accurate determination of the issue of guilt or innocence This is the ground upon which the American Bar Association Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial Approved Draft 1970 has unanimously recommended broader discovery The United States Supreme Court has said that the pretrial disclosure of a defendant s statements may be the better practice Cicenia v La Gay 357 U S 504 511 78 S Ct 1297 2 L Ed 2d 1523 1958 See also Leland v Oregon 343 U S 790 72 S Ct 1002 96 L Ed 1302 1952 State v Johnson 28 N J 133 145 A 2d 313 1958 The requirement that the statement be disclosed prior to trial rather than waiting until the trial also contributes to efficiency of administration It is during the pretrial stage that the defendant usually decides whether to plead guilty See United States v Projansky supra The pretrial stage is also the time during which many objections to the admissibility of types of evidence ought to be made Pretrial disclosure ought therefore to contribute both to an informed guilty plea practice and to a pretrial resolution of admissibility questions See ABA Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial § 1 2 and Commentary pp 40 – 43 Approved Draft 1970 The American Bar Association Standards mandate the prosecutor to make the required disclosure even though not requested to do so by the defendant The proposed draft requires the defendant to request discovery although obviously the attorney for the government may disclose without waiting for a request and there are situations in which due process will require the prosecution on its own to disclose evidence helpful to the defense Brady v Maryland 373 U S 83 83 S Ct 1194 10 L Ed 2d 215 1963 Giles v Maryland 386 U S 66 87 S Ct 793 17 L Ed 2d 737 1967 The requirement in subdivision a 1 A is that the government produce statements without further discussion of what statement includes There has been some recent controversy over what statements are subject to discovery under the current rule See Discovery in Criminal Cases 44 F R D 481 1968 C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure Criminal § 253 pp 505 – 506

surveillance United States v Black 282 F Supp 35 D D C 1968 The court in United States v Iovinelli 276 F Supp 629 631 N D Ill 1967 declared that statements as used in old rule 16 is not restricted to the substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement or to statements which are a recital of past occurrences The Jencks Act 18 U S C § 3500 defines statements of government witnesses discoverable for purposes of cross examination as 1 a written statement signed or otherwise approved by a witness 2 a stenographic mechanical electrical or other recording or a transcription thereof which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by said witness to an agent of the government and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement 18 U S C § 3500 e The language of the Jencks Act has most often led to a restrictive definition of statements confining statements to the defendant s own words See Hanks v United States 388 F 2d 171 10th Cir 1968 and Augenblick v United States 377 F 2d 586 180 Ct Cl 131 1967 The American Bar Association s Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial Approved Draft 1970 do not attempt to define statements because of a disagreement among members of the committee as to what the definition should be The majority rejected the restrictive definition of statements contained in the Jencks Act 18 U S C § 3500 e in the view that the defendant ought to be able to see his statement in whatever form it may have been preserved in fairness to the defendant and to discourage the practice where it exists of destroying original notes after transforming them into secondary transcriptions in order to avoid cross examination based upon the original notes See Campbell v United States 373 U S 487 83 S Ct 1356 10 L Ed 2d 501 1963 The minority favored a restrictive definition of statements in the view that the use of other than verbatim statements would subject witnesses to unfair cross examination See American Bar Association s Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial pp 61 – 64 Approved Draft 1970 The draft of subdivision a 1 A leaves the matter of the meaning of the term unresolved and thus left for development on a case by case basis Subdivision a 1 A also provides for mandatory disclosure of a summary of any oral statement made by defendant to a government agent which the attorney for the government intends to use in evidence The reasons for permitting the defendant to discover his own statements seem obviously to apply to the substance of any oral statement which the government intends to use in evidence at the trial See American Bar Association Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial § 2 1 a ii Approved Draft 1970 Certainly disclosure will facilitate the raising of objections to admissibility prior to trial There have been several conflicting decisions under the current rules as to whether the government must disclose the substance of oral statements of the defendant which it has in its possession Cf United States v Baker 262 F Supp 657 D C D C 1966 United States v Curry 278 F Supp 508 N D Ill 1967 United States v Morrison 43 F

considerable support for the policy of disclosing the substance of the defendant s oral statement Many courts have indicated that this is a better practice than denying such disclosure E g United States v Curry supra Loux v United States 389 F 2d 911 9th Cir 1968 and United States v Baker supra Subdivision a 1 A also provides for mandatory disclosure of any recorded testimony which defendant gives before a grand jury if the testimony relates to the offense charged The present rule is discretionary and is applicable only to those of defendant s statements which are relevant The traditional rationale behind grand jury secrecy — protection of witnesses — does not apply when the accused seeks discovery of his own testimony Cf Dennis v United States 384 U S 855 86 S Ct 1840 16 L Ed 2d 973 1966 and Allen v United States 129 U S App D C 61 390 F 2d 476 1968 In interpreting the rule many judges have granted defendant discovery without a showing of need or relevance United States v Gleason

relevance conforms to the recommendation of the American Bar Association Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial § 2 1 a iii and Commentary pp 64 – 66 Approved Draft 1970 Also see Note Discovery by a Criminal Defendant of His Own Grand Jury Testimony 68 Columbia L Rev 311 1968 In a situation involving a corporate defendant statements made by present and former officers and employees relating to their employment have been held discoverable as statements of the defendant United States v Hughes 413 F 2d 1244 5th Cir 1969 The rule makes clear that such statements are discoverable if the officer or employee was able legally to bind the defendant in respect to the activities involved in the charges Subdivision a 1 B allows discovery of the defendant s prior criminal record A defendant may be uncertain of the precise nature of his prior record and it seems therefore in the interest of efficient and fair administration to make it possible to resolve prior to trial any disputes as to the correctness of the relevant criminal record of the defendant Subdivision a 1 C gives a right of discovery of certain tangible objects under the specified circumstances Courts have construed the old rule as making disclosure discretionary with the judge Cf United States v Kaminsky 275 F Supp 365 S D N Y 1967 Gevinson v United States 358 F 2d 761 5th Cir 1966 cert denied 385 U S 823 87 S Ct 51 17 L Ed 2d 60 1966 and United States v Tanner 279 F Supp 457 N D Ill 1967 The old rule requires a showing of materiality to the preparation of his defense and that the request is reasonable The new rule requires disclosure if any one of three situations exists a the defendant shows that disclosure of the document or tangible object is material to the defense b the government intends to use the document or tangible object in its presentation of its case in chief or c the document or tangible object was obtained from or belongs to the defendant Disclosure of documents and tangible objects which are material to the preparation of the defense may be required under the rule of Brady v Maryland 373 U S 83 83 S Ct 1194 10 L Ed 2d 215 1963 without an additional showing that the request is reasonable In Brady the court held that due process requires that the prosecution disclose evidence favorable to the accused Although the Advisory Committee decided not to codify the Brady Rule the requirement that the government disclose documents and tangible objects material to the preparation of his defense underscores the importance of disclosure of evidence favorable to the defendant Limiting the rule to situations in which the defendant can show that the evidence is material seems unwise It may be difficult for a defendant to make this showing if he does not know what the evidence is For this reason subdivision a 1 C also contains language to compel disclosure if the government intends to use the property as evidence at the trial or if the property was obtained from or belongs to the defendant See ABA Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial § 2 1 a v and Commentary pp 68 – 69 Approved Draft 1970 This is probably the result under old rule 16 since the fact that the government intends to use the physical evidence at the trial is probably sufficient proof of materiality C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure Criminal § 254 especially n 70 at p 513 1969 Supp 1971 But it seems desirable to make this explicit in the rule itself Requiring disclosure of documents and tangible objects which were obtained from or belong to the defendant probably is also making explicit in the rule what would otherwise be the interpretation of materiality See C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure Criminal § 254 at p 510 especially n 58 1969 Supp 1971 Subdivision a 1 C is also amended to add the word photographs to the objects previously listed See ABA Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial § 2 1 a v Approved Draft 1970 Subdivision a 1 D makes disclosure of the reports of examinations and tests mandatory This is the recommendation of the ABA Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial § 2 1 a iv and Commentary pp 66 – 68 Approved Draft 1970 The obligation of disclosure applies only to scientific tests or experiments made in connection with the particular case So limited mandatory disclosure seems justified because 1 it is difficult to test expert testimony at trial without advance notice and preparation 2 it is not likely that such evidence will be distorted or misused if disclosed prior to trial and 3 to the extent that a test may be favorable to the defense its disclosure is mandated under the rule of Brady v Maryland supra Subdivision a 1 E is new It provides for discovery of the names of witnesses to be called by the government and of the prior criminal record of these witnesses Many states have statutes or rules which require that the accused be notified prior to trial of the witnesses to be called against him See e g Alaska R Crim Proc 7 c Ariz R Crim Proc 153 17 A R S 1956 Ark Stat Ann § 43 – 1001 1947 Cal Pen Code § 995n West 1957 Colo Rev Stat Ann §§ 39 – 3 – 6 39

statements must be made available to defense counsel after the witness testifies on direct examination for possible impeachment purposes during trial 18 U S C § 3500 The American Bar Association s Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial § 2 1 a i Approved Draft 1970 require disclosure of both the names and the statements of prosecution witnesses Subdivision a 1 E requires only disclosure prior to trial of names addresses and prior criminal record It does not require disclosure of the witnesses statements although the rule does not preclude the parties from agreeing to disclose statements prior to trial This is done for example in courts using the so called omnibus hearing Disclosure of the prior criminal record of witnesses places the defense in the same position as the government which normally has knowledge of the defendant s record and the record of anticipated defense witnesses In addition the defendant often lacks means of procuring this information on his own See American Bar Association Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial § 2 1 a vi Approved Draft 1970 A principal argument against disclosure of the identity of witnesses prior to trial has been the danger to the witness his being subjected either to physical harm or to threats designed to make the witness unavailable or to influence him to change his testimony

Cir 1962 and House of Materials Inc v Simplicity Pattern Co 298 F 2d 867 2d Cir 1962 The government has two alternatives when it believes disclosure will create an undue risk of harm to the witness It can ask for a protective order under subdivision d 1 See ABA Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial § 2 5 b Approved Draft 1970 It can also move the court to allow the perpetuation of a particular witness s testimony for use at trial if the witness is unavailable or later changes his testimony The purpose of the latter alternative is to make pretrial disclosure possible and at the same time to minimize any inducement to use improper means to force the witness either to not show up or to change his testimony before a jury See rule 15 Subdivision a 2 is substantially unchanged It limits the discovery otherwise allowed by providing that the government need not disclose reports memoranda or other internal government documents made by the attorney for the government or other government agents in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case or statements made by government witnesses or prospective government witnesses The only proposed change is that the reports memoranda or other internal government documents made by the attorney for the government are included to make clear that the work product of the government attorney is protected See C

grand jury are explicitly dealt with in rule 6 and subdivision a 1 A of rule 16 and thus are not covered by other provisions such as subdivision a 1 C which deals generally with discovery of documents in the possession custody or control of the government Subdivision a 4 is designed to insure that the government will not be penalized if it makes a full disclosure of all potential witnesses and then decides not to call one or more of the witnesses listed This is not however intended to abrogate the defendant s right to comment generally upon the government s failure to call witnesses in an appropriate case Subdivision b deals with the government s right to discovery of defense evidence or put in other terms with the extent to which a defendant is required to disclose its evidence to the prosecution prior to trial Subdivision b replaces old subdivision c Subdivision b enlarges the right of government discovery in several ways 1 it gives the government the right to discovery of lists of defense witnesses as well as physical evidence and the results of examinations and tests 2 it requires disclosure if the defendant has the evidence under his control and intends to use it at trial in his case in chief without the additional burden required by the old rule of having to show in behalf of the government that the evidence is material and the request reasonable and 3 it gives the government the right to discovery without conditioning that right upon the existence of a prior request for discovery by the defendant Although the government normally has resources adequate to secure much of the evidence for trial there are situations in which pretrial disclosure of evidence to the government is in the interest of effective and fair criminal justice administration For example the experimental omnibus hearing procedure see discussion in Advisory Committee Note to rule 12 is based upon an assumption that the defendant as well as the government will be willing to disclose evidence prior to trial Having reached the conclusion that it is desirable to require broader disclosure by the defendant under certain circumstances the Advisory Committee has taken the view that it is preferable to give the right of discovery to the government independently of a prior request for discovery by the defendant This is the recommendation of the American Bar Association Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial Commentary pp 43 – 46 Approved Draft 1970 It is sometimes asserted that making the government s right to discovery conditional will minimize the risk

that if mandatory disclosure applies only to those items which the accused intends to introduce in evidence at trial neither the incriminatory nor the involuntary aspects of the privilege against self incrimination are present On balance the Advisory Committee is of the view that an independent right of discovery for both the defendant and the government is likely to contribute to both effective and fair administration See Louisell Criminal Discovery and Self Incrimination Roger Traynor Confronts the Dilemma 53 Calif L Rev 89 1965 for an analysis of the difficulty of weighing the value of broad discovery against the value which inheres in not requiring the defendant to disclose anything which might work to his disadvantage Subdivision b 1 A provides that the defendant shall disclose any documents and tangible objects which he has in his possession custody or control and which he intends to introduce in evidence in his case in chief Subdivision b 1 B provides that the defendant shall disclose the results of physical or mental examinations and scientific tests or experiments if a they were made in connection with a particular case b the defendant has them under his control and c he intends to offer them in evidence in his case in chief or which were prepared by a defense witness and the results or reports relate to the witness s testimony In cases where both prosecution and defense have employed experts to conduct tests such as psychiatric examinations it seems as important for the government to be able to study the results reached by defense experts which are to be called by the defendant as it does for the defendant to study those of government experts See Schultz Criminal Discovery by the Prosecution Frontier Developments and Some Proposals for the Future 22 N

witnesses the defendant intends to call in his case in chief State cases have indicated that disclosure of a list of defense witnesses does not violate the defendant s privilege against self incrimination See Jones v Superior Court of Nevada County supra and People v Lopez supra The defendant has the same option as does the government if it is believed that disclosure of the identity of a witness may subject that witness to harm or a threat of harm The defendant can ask for a protective order under subdivision d 1 or can take a deposition in accordance with the terms of rule 15 Subdivision b 2 is unchanged appearing as the last sentence of subdivision c of old rule 16 Subdivision b 3 provides that the defendant s failure to introduce evidence or call witnesses shall not be admissible in evidence against him In states which require pretrial disclosure of witnesses identity the prosecution is not allowed to comment upon the defendant s failure to call a listed witness See

to abrogate the government s right to comment generally upon the defendant s failure to call witnesses in an appropriate case other than the defendant s failure to testify Subdivision c is a restatement of part of old rule 16 g Subdivision d 1 deals with the protective order Although the rule does not attempt to indicate when a protective order should be entered it is obvious that one would be appropriate where there is reason to believe that a witness would be subject to physical or economic harm if his identity is revealed See Will v United States 389 U S 90 88 S Ct 269 19 L Ed

appropriate occasions for the trial judge to decide questions relating to pretrial disclosure See Alderman v United States 394 U S at 182 n 14 89 S Ct 961 Subdivision d 2 is a restatement of part of old rule 16 g and d Old subdivision f of rule 16 dealing with time of motions is dropped because rule 12 c provides the judge with authority to set the time for the making of pretrial motions including requests for discovery Rule 12 also prescribes the consequences which follow from a failure to make a pretrial motion at the time fixed by the court See rule 12 f Notes of Committee on the Judiciary House Report No 94 – 247 1975 Amendment A Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regulates discovery by the defendant of evidence in possession of the prosecution and discovery by the prosecution of evidence in possession of the defendant The present rule permits the defendant to move the court to discover certain material The prosecutor s discovery is limited and is reciprocal — that is if the defendant is granted discovery of certain items then the prosecution may move for discovery of similar items under the defendant s control As proposed to be amended the rule provides that the parties themselves will accomplish discovery — no motion need be filed and no court order is necessary The court will intervene only to resolve a dispute as to whether something is discoverable or to issue a protective order The proposed rule enlarges the scope of the defendant s discovery to include a copy of his prior criminal record and a list of the names and addresses plus record of prior felony convictions of all witnesses the prosecution intends to call during its case in chief It also permits the defendant to discover the substance of any oral statement of his which the prosecution intends to offer at trial if the statement was given in response to interrogation by any person known by defendant to be a government agent Proposed subdivision a 2 provides that Rule 16 does not authorize the defendant to discover reports memoranda or other internal government documents made by the attorney for the government or other government agents in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case The proposed rule also enlarges the scope of the government s discovery of materials in the custody of the defendant The government is entitled to a list of the names and addresses of the witnesses the defendant intends to call during his case in chief Proposed subdivision b 2 protects the defendant from having to disclose reports memoranda or other internal defense documents made in connection with the investigation or defense of the case Subdivision d 1 of the proposed rule permits the court to deny restrict or defer discovery by either party or to make such other order as is appropriate Upon request a party may make a showing that such an order is necessary This showing shall be made to the judge alone if the party so requests If the court enters an order after such a showing it must seal the record of the showing and preserve it in the event there is an appeal B Committee Action The Committee agrees that the parties should to the maximum possible extent accomplish discovery themselves The court should become involved only when it is necessary to resolve a dispute or to issue an order pursuant to subdivision d Perhaps the most controversial amendments to this rule were those dealing with witness lists Under present law the government must turn over a witness list only in capital cases [ Section 3432 of title 18 of the United States Code provides A person charged with treason or other capital offense shall at least three entire days before commencement of trial be furnished with a copy of the indictment and a list of the veniremen and of the witnesses to be produced on the trial for proving the indictment stating the place of abode of each venireman and witness ] The defendant never needs to turn over a list of his witnesses The proposed rule requires both the government and the defendant to turn over witness lists in every case capital or noncapital Moreover the lists must be furnished to the adversary party upon that party s request The proposed rule was sharply criticized by both prosecutors and defenders The prosecutors feared that pretrial disclosure of prosecution witnesses would result in harm to witnesses The defenders argued that a defendant cannot constitutionally be compelled to disclose his witnesses The Committee believes that it is desirable to promote greater pretrial discovery As stated in the Advisory Committee Note broader discovery by both the defense and the prosecution will contribute to the fair and efficient administration of criminal justice by aiding in informed plea negotiations by minimizing the undesirable effect of surprise at trial and by otherwise contributing to an accurate determination of the issue of guilt or innocence The Committee therefore endorses the principle that witness lists are discoverable However the Committee has attempted to strike a balance between the narrow provisions of existing law and the broad provisions of the proposed rule The Committee rule makes the procedures defendant triggered If the defendant asks for and receives a list of prosecution witnesses then the prosecution may request a list of defense witnesses The witness lists need not be turned over until 3 days before trial The court can modify the terms of discovery upon a sufficient showing Thus the court can require disclosure of the witness lists earlier than 3 days before trial or can permit a party not to disclose the identity of a witness before trial The Committee provision promotes broader discovery and its attendant values — informed disposition of cases without trial minimizing the undesirable effect of surprise and helping insure that the issue of guilt or innocence is accurately determined At the same time it avoids the problems suggested by both the prosecutors and the defenders The major argument advanced by prosecutors is the risk of danger to their witnesses if their identities are disclosed prior to trial The Committee recognizes that there may be a risk but believes that the risk is not as great as some fear that it is Numerous states require the prosecutor to provide the defendant with a list of prosecution witnesses prior to trial [ These States include Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Florida Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Michigan Minnesota Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada Oklahoma Oregon Tennessee and Utah See Advisory Committee Note House Document 93 – 292 at 60 ] The evidence before the Committee indicates that these states have not experienced unusual problems of witness intimidation [ See the comments of the Standing Committee on Criminal Law and Procedure of the State Bar of California in Hearings II at 302 ] Some federal jurisdictions have adopted an omnibus pretrial discovery procedure that calls upon the prosecutor to give the defendant its witness lists One such jurisdiction is the Southern District of California The evidence before the Committee indicates that there has been no unusual problems with witness intimidation in that district Charles Sevilla Chief Trial Attorney for the Federal Defenders of San Diego Inc which operates in the Southern District of California testified as follows The Government in one of its statements to this committee indicated that providing the defense with witness lists will cause coerced witness perjury This does not happen We receive Government witness lists as a matter of course in the Southern District and it s a rare occasion when there is any overture by a defense witness or by a defendant to a Government witness It simply doesn t happen except on the rarest of occasion When the Government has that fear it can resort to the protective order [ Hearings II at 42 ] Mr Sevilla s observations are corroborated by the views of the U S Attorney for the Southern District of California Concerning the modifications to Rule 16 we have followed these procedures informally in this district for a number of years We were one of the districts selected for the pilot projects of the Omnibus Hearing in 1967 or 1968 We have found that the courts in our district will not require us to disclose names of proposed witnesses when in our judgment to do so would not be advisable Otherwise we routinely provide defense counsel with full discovery including names and addresses of witnesses We have not had any untoward results by following this program having in mind that the courts will and have excused us from discovery where the circumstances warrant [ Hearings I at 109 ] Much of the prosecutorial criticism of requiring the prosecution to give a list of its witnesses to the defendant reflects an unwillingness to trust judges to exercise sound judgment in the public interest Prosecutors have stated that they frequently will open their files to defendants in order to induce pleas [ See testimony of Richard L Thornburgh United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania in Hearings I at 150 ] Prosecutors are willing to determine on their own when they can do this without jeopardizing the safety of witnesses There is no reason why a judicial officer cannot exercise the same discretion in the public interest The Committee is convinced that in the usual case there is no serious risk of danger to prosecution witnesses from pretrial disclosure of their identities In exceptional instances there may be a risk of danger The Committee rule however is capable of dealing with those exceptional instances while still providing for disclosure of witnesses in the usual case The Committee recognizes the force of the constitutional arguments advanced by defenders Requiring a defendant upon request to give to the prosecution material which may be incriminating certainly raises very serious constitutional problems The Committee deals with these problems by having the defendant trigger the discovery procedures Since the defendant has no constitutional right to discover any of the prosecution s evidence unless it is exculpatory within the meaning of Brady v Maryland 373 U S 83 1963 it is permissible to condition his access to nonexculpatory evidence upon his turning over a list of defense witnesses Rule 16 currently operates in this manner The Committee also changed subdivisions a 2 and b 2 which set forth work product exceptions to the general discovery requirements The subsections proposed by the Supreme Court are cast in terms of the type of document involved e g report rather than in terms of the content e g legal theory The Committee recast these provisions by adopting language from Rule 26 b 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure The Committee notes that subdivision a 1 C permits the defendant to discover certain items that were obtained from or belong to the defendant The Committee believes that as indicated in the Advisory Committee Note [ House Document 93 – 292 at 59 ] items that were obtained from or belong to the defendant are items that are material to the preparation of his defense The Committee added language to subdivision a 1 B to conform it to provisions in subdivision a 1 A The rule as changed by the Committee requires the prosecutor to give the defendant such copy of the defendant s prior criminal record as is within the prosecutor s possession custody or control the existence of which is known or by the exercise of due diligence may become known to the prosecutor The Committee also made a similar conforming change in subdivision a 1 E dealing with the criminal records of government witnesses The prosecutor can ordinarily discharge his obligation under these two subdivisions a 1 B and E by obtaining a copy of the F B I rap sheet The Committee made an additional change in subdivision a 1 E The proposed rule required the prosecutor to provide the defendant with a record of the felony convictions of government witnesses The major purpose for letting the defendant discover information about the record of government witnesses is to provide him with information concerning the credibility of those witnesses Rule 609 a of the Federal Rules of Evidence permits a party to attack the credibility of a witness with convictions other than just felony convictions The Committee therefore changed subdivision a 1 E to require the prosecutor to turn over a record of all criminal convictions not just felony convictions The Committee changed subdivision d 1 which deals with protective orders Proposed d 1 required the court to conduct an ex parte proceeding whenever a party so requested The Committee changed the mandatory language to permissive language A Court may not must conduct an ex parte proceeding if a party so requests Thus if a party requests a protective or modifying order and asks to make its showing ex parte the court has two separate determinations to make First it must determine whether an ex parte proceeding is appropriate bearing in mind that ex parte proceedings are disfavored and not to be encouraged [ An ex parte proceeding would seem to be appropriate if any adversary proceeding would defeat the purpose of the protective or modifying order For example the identity of a witness would be disclosed and the purpose of the protective order is to conceal that witness identity ] Second it must determine whether a protective or modifying order shall issue Conference Committee Notes House Report No 94 – 414 1975 Amendment Rule 16 deals with pretrial discovery by the defendant and the government The House and Senate versions of the bill differ on Rule 16 in several respects A Reciprocal vs Independent Discovery for the Government — The House version of the bill provides that the government s discovery is reciprocal If the defendant requires and receives certain items from the government then the government is entitled to get similar items from the defendant The Senate version of the bill gives the government an independent right to discover material in the possession of the defendant The Conference adopts the House provisions B Rule 16 a 1 A — The House version permits an organization to discover relevant recorded grand jury testimony of any witness who was at the time of the acts charged or of the grand jury proceedings so situated as an officer or employee as to have been able legally to bind it in respect to the activities involved in the charges The Senate version limits discovery of this material to testimony of a witness who was at the time of the grand jury proceeding so situated as an officer or employee as to have been legally to bind the defendant in respect to the activities involved in the charges The Conferees share a concern that during investigations ex employees and ex officers of potential corporate defendants are a critical source of information regarding activities of their former corporate employers It is not unusual that at the time of their testimony or interview these persons may have interests which are substantially adverse to or divergent from the putative corporate defendant It is also not unusual that such individuals though no longer sharing a community of interest with the corporation may nevertheless be subject to pressure from their former employers Such pressure may derive from the fact that the ex employees or ex officers have remained in the same industry or related industry are employed by competitors suppliers or customers of their former employers or have pension or other deferred compensation arrangements with former employers The Conferees also recognize that considerations of fairness require that a defendant corporation or other legal entity be entitled to the grand jury testimony of a former officer or employee if that person was personally involved in the conduct constituting the offense and was able legally to bind the defendant in respect to the conduct in which he was involved The Conferees decided that on balance a defendant organization should not be entitled to the relevant grand jury testimony of a former officer or employee in every instance However a defendant organization should be entitled to it if the former officer or employee was personally involved in the alleged conduct constituting the offense and was so situated as to have been able legally to bind the defendant in respect to the alleged conduct The Conferees note that even in those situations where the rule provides for disclosure of the testimony the Government may upon a sufficient showing obtain a protective or modifying order pursuant to Rule 16 d 1 The Conference adopts a provision that permits a defendant organization to discover relevant grant jury testimony of a witness who 1 was at the time of his testimony so situated as an officer or employee as to have been able legally to bind the defendant in respect to conduct constituting the offense or 2 was at the time of the offense personally involved in the alleged conduct constituting the offense and so situated as an officer or employee as to have been able legally to bind the defendant in respect to that alleged conduct in which he was involved C Rules 16 a 1 E and b 1 C witness lists — The House version of the bill provides that each party the government and the defendant may discover the names and addresses of the other party s witnesses 3 days before trial The Senate version of the bill eliminates these provisions thereby making the names and addresses of a party s witnesses nondiscoverable The Senate version also makes a conforming change in Rule 16 d 1 The Conference adopts the Senate version A majority of the Conferees believe it is not in the interest of the effective administration of criminal justice to require that the government or the defendant be forced to reveal the names and addresses of its witnesses before trial Discouragement of witnesses and improper contact directed at influencing their testimony were deemed paramount concerns in the formulation of this policy D Rules 16 a 2 and b 2 — Rules 16 a 2 and b 2 define certain types of materials work product not to be discoverable The House version defines work product to be the mental impressions conclusions opinions or legal theories of the attorney for the government or other government agents This is parallel to the definition in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure The Senate version returns to the Supreme Court s language and defines work product to be reports memoranda or other internal government documents This is the language of the present rule The Conference adopts the Senate provision The Conferees note that a party may not avoid a legitimate discovery request merely because something is labelled report memorandum or internal document For example if a document qualifies as a statement of the defendant within the meaning of the Rule 16 a 1 A then the labelling of that document as report memorandum or internal government document will not shield that statement from discovery Likewise if the results of an experiment qualify as the results of a scientific test within the meaning of Rule 16 b 1 B then the results of that experiment are not shielded from discovery even if they are labelled report memorandum or internal defense document Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1983 Amendment Note to Subdivision a 3 The added language is made necessary by the addition of Rule 26 2 and new subdivision i of Rule 12 which contemplate the production of statements including those made to a grand jury under specified circumstances Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment The amendments are technical No substantive change is intended Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1991 Amendment The amendment to Rule 16 a 1 A expands slightly government disclosure to the defense of statements made by the defendant The rule now requires the prosecution upon request to disclose any written record which contains reference to a relevant oral statement by the defendant which was in response to interrogation without regard to whether the prosecution intends to use the statement at trial The change recognizes that the defendant has some proprietary interest in statements made during interrogation regardless of the prosecution s intent to make any use of the statements The written record need not be a transcription or summary of the defendant s statement but must only be some written reference which would provide some means for the prosecution and defense to identify the statement Otherwise the prosecution would have the difficult task of locating and disclosing the myriad oral statements made by a defendant even if it had no intention of using the statements at trial In a lengthy and complicated investigation with multiple interrogations by different government agents that task could become unduly burdensome The existing requirement to disclose oral statements which the prosecution intends to introduce at trial has also been changed slightly Under the amendment the prosecution must also disclose any relevant oral statement which it intends to use at trial without regard to whether it intends to introduce the statement Thus an oral statement by the defendant which would only be used for impeachment purposes would be covered by the rule The introductory language to the rule has been modified to clarify that without regard to whether the defendant s statement is oral or written it must at a minimum be disclosed Although the rule does not specify the means for disclosing the defendant s statements if they are in written or recorded form the defendant is entitled to inspect copy or photograph them Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1993 Amendment New subdivisions a 1 E and b 1 C expand federal criminal discovery by requiring disclosure of the intent to rely on expert opinion testimony what the testimony will consist of and the bases of the testimony The amendment is intended to minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony reduce the need for continuances and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert s testimony through focused cross examination See Eads Adjudication by Ambush Federal Prosecutors Use of Nonscientific Experts in a System of Limited Criminal Discovery 67 N C L Rev 577 622 1989 Like other provisions in Rule 16 subdivision a 1 E requires the government to disclose information regarding its expert witnesses if the defendant first requests the information Once the requested information is provided the government is entitled under b 1 C to reciprocal discovery of the same information from the defendant The disclosure is in the form of a written summary and only applies to expert witnesses that each side intends to call Although no specific timing requirements are included it is expected that the parties will make their requests and disclosures in a timely fashion With increased use of both scientific and nonscientific expert testimony one of counsel s most basic discovery needs is to learn that an expert is expected to testify See Gianelli Criminal Discovery Scientific Evidence and DNA 44 Vand L Rev 793 1991 Symposium on Science and the Rules of Legal Procedure 101 F R D 599 1983 This is particularly important if the expert is expected to testify on matters which touch on new or controversial techniques or opinions The amendment is intended to meet this need by first requiring notice of the expert s qualifications which in turn will permit the requesting party to determine whether in fact the witness is an expert within the definition of Federal Rule of Evidence 702 Like Rule 702 which generally provides a broad definition of who qualifies as an expert the amendment is broad in that it includes both scientific and nonscientific experts It does not distinguish between those cases where the expert will be presenting testimony on novel scientific evidence The rule does not extend however to witnesses who may offer only lay opinion testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 701 Nor does the amendment extend to summary witnesses who may testify under Federal Rule of Evidence 1006 unless the witness is called to offer expert opinions apart from or in addition to the summary evidence Second the requesting party is entitled to a summary of the expected testimony This provision is intended to permit more complete pretrial preparation by the requesting party For example this should inform the requesting party whether the expert will be providing only background information on a particular issue or whether the witness will actually offer an opinion In some instances a generic description of the likely witness and that witness s qualifications may be sufficient e g where a DEA laboratory chemist will testify but it is not clear which particular chemist will be available Third and perhaps most important the requesting party is to be provided with a summary of the bases of the expert s opinion Rule 16 a 1 D covers disclosure and access to any results or reports of mental or physical examinations and scientific testing But the fact that no formal written reports have been made does not necessarily mean that an expert will not testify at trial At least one federal court has concluded that that provision did not otherwise require the government to disclose the identify of its expert witnesses where no reports had been prepared See e g United States v Johnson 713 F 2d 654 11th Cir 1983 cert denied 484 U S 956 1984 there is no right to witness list and Rule 16 was not implicated because no reports were made in the case The amendment should remedy that problem Without regard to whether a party would be entitled to the underlying bases for expert testimony under other provisions of Rule 16 the amendment requires a summary of the bases relied upon by the expert That should cover not only written and oral reports tests reports and investigations but any information that might be recognized as a legitimate basis for an opinion under Federal Rule of Evidence 703 including opinions of other experts The amendments are not intended to create unreasonable procedural hurdles As with other discovery requests under Rule 16 subdivision d is available to either side to seek ex parte a protective or modifying order concerning requests for information under a 1 E or b 1 C Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1994 Amendment The amendment is intended to clarify that the discovery and disclosure requirements of the rule apply equally to individual and organizational defendants See In re United States 918 F 2d 138 11th Cir 1990 rejecting distinction between individual and organizational defendants Because an organizational defendant may not know what its officers or agents have said or done in regard to a charged offense it is important that it have access to statements made by persons whose statements or actions could be binding on the defendant See also United States v Hughes 413 F 2d 1244 1251 – 52 5th Cir 1969 vacated as moot 397 U S 93 1970 prosecution of corporations often resembles the most complex civil cases necessitating a vigorous probing of the mass of detailed facts to seek out the truth The amendment defines defendant in a broad nonexclusive fashion See also 18 U S C § 18 the term organization includes a person other than an individual And the amendment recognizes that an organizational defendant could be bound by an agent s statement see e g Federal Rule of Evidence 801 d 2 or be vicariously liable for an agent s actions The amendment contemplates that upon request of the defendant the Government will disclose any statements within the purview of the rule and made by persons whom the government contends to be among the classes of persons described in the rule There is no requirement that the defense stipulate or admit that such persons were in a position to bind the defendant Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1997 Amendment Subdivision a 1 E Under Rule 16 a 1 E as amended in 1993 the defense is entitled to disclosure of certain information about expert witnesses which the government intends to call during the trial And if the government provides that information it is entitled to reciprocal discovery under b 1 C This amendment is a parallel reciprocal disclosure provision which is triggered by a government request for information concerning defense expert witnesses as to the defendant s mental condition which is provided for in an amendment to b 1 C infra Subdivision b 1 C Amendments in 1993 to Rule 16 included provisions for pretrial disclosure of information including names and expected testimony of both defense and government expert witnesses Those disclosures are triggered by defense requests for the information If the defense makes such requests and the government complies the government is entitled to similar reciprocal discovery The amendment to Rule 16 b 1 C provides that if the defendant has notified the government under Rule 12 2 of an intent to rely on expert testimony to show the defendant s mental condition the government may request the defense to disclose information about its expert witnesses Although Rule 12 2 insures that the government will not be surprised by the nature of the defense or that the defense intends to call an expert witness that rule makes no provision for discovery of the identity the expected testimony or the qualifications of the expert witness The amendment provides the government with the limited right to respond to the notice provided under Rule 12 2 by requesting more specific information about the expert If the government requests the specified information and the defense complies the defense is entitled to reciprocal discovery under an amendment to subdivision a 1 E supra Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 16 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only except as noted below Current Rule 16 a 1 A is now located in Rule 16 a 1 A B and C Current Rule 16 a 1 B C D and E have been relettered Amended Rule 16 b 1 B includes a change that may be substantive in nature Rule 16 a 1 E and 16 a 1 F require production of specified information if the government intends to use the information in its case in chief at trial The Committee believed that the language in revised Rule 16 b 1 B which deals with a defendant s disclosure of information to the government should track the similar language in revised Rule 16 a 1 In Rule 16 b 1 B ii the Committee changed the current provision which reads the defendant intends to introduce as evidence to the defendant intends to use the item The Committee recognized that this might constitute a substantive change in the rule but believed that it was a necessary conforming change with the provisions in Rule 16 a 1 E and F noted supra regarding use of evidence by the government In amended Rule 16 d 1 the last phrase in the current subdivision — which refers to a possible appeal of the court s discovery order — has been deleted In the Committee s view no substantive change results from that deletion The language is unnecessary because the court regardless of whether there is an appeal will have maintained the record Finally current Rule 16 e which addresses the topic of notice of alibi witnesses has been deleted as being unnecessarily duplicative of Rule 12 1 Committee Notes on Rules — 2013 Amendment Subdivision a Paragraph a 2 is amended to clarify that the 2002 restyling of Rule 16 did not change the protection afforded to government work product Prior to restyling in 2002 Rule 16 a 1 C required the government to allow the defendant to inspect and copy books papers [ and ] documents material to his defense Rule 16 a 2 however stated that except as provided by certain enumerated subparagraphs — not including Rule 16 a 1 C — Rule 16 a did not authorize the discovery or inspection of reports memoranda or other internal government documents made by the attorney for the government Reading these two provisions together the Supreme Court concluded that a defendant may examine documents material to his defense but under Rule 16 a 2 he may not examine Government work product United States v Armstrong 517 U S 456 463 1996 With one exception not relevant here the 2002 restyling of Rule 16 was intended to work no substantive change Nevertheless because restyled Rule 16 a 2 eliminated the enumerated subparagraphs of its successor and contained no express exception for the materials previously covered by Rule 16 a 1 C redesignated as subparagraph a 1 E some courts have been urged to construe the restyled rule as eliminating protection for government work product Courts have uniformly declined to construe the restyling changes to Rule 16 a 2 to effect a substantive alteration in the scope of protection previously afforded to government work product by that rule Correctly recognizing that restyling was intended to effect no substantive change courts have invoked the doctrine of the scrivener s error to excuse confusion caused by the elimination of the enumerated subparagraphs from the restyled rules See e g United States v Rudolph 224 F R D 503 504 – 11 N D Ala 2004 and United States v Fort 472 F 3d 1106 1110 n 2 9th Cir 2007 adopting the Rudolph court s analysis By restoring the enumerated subparagraphs the amendment makes it clear that a defendant s pretrial access to books papers and documents under Rule 16 a 1 E remains subject to the limitations imposed by Rule 16 a 2 Changes Made After Publication and Comment No changes were made after publication and

subpoena must state the court s name and the title of the proceeding include the seal of the court and command the witness to attend and testify at the time and place the subpoena specifies The clerk must issue a blank subpoena — signed and sealed — to the party requesting it and that party must fill in the blanks before the subpoena is served b Defendant Unable to Pay Upon a defendant s ex parte application the court must order that a subpoena be issued for a named witness if the defendant shows an inability to pay the witness s fees and the necessity of the witness s presence for an adequate defense If the court orders a subpoena to be issued the process costs and witness fees will be paid in the same manner as those paid for witnesses the government subpoenas c Producing Documents and Objects 1 In General A subpoena may order the witness to produce any books papers documents data or other objects the subpoena designates The court may direct the witness to produce the designated items in court before trial or before they are to be offered in evidence When the items arrive the court may permit the parties and their attorneys to inspect all or part of them 2 Quashing or Modifying the Subpoena On motion made promptly the court may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive 3 Subpoena for Personal or Confidential Information About a Victim After a complaint indictment or information is filed a subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court order Before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object d Service A marshal a deputy marshal or any nonparty who is at least 18 years old may serve a subpoena The server must deliver a copy of the subpoena to the witness and must tender to the witness one day s witness attendance fee and the legal mileage allowance The server need not tender the attendance fee or mileage allowance when the United States a federal officer or a federal agency has requested the subpoena e Place of Service 1 In the United States A subpoena requiring a witness to attend a hearing or trial may be served at any place within the United States 2 In a Foreign Country If the witness is in a foreign country 28 U S C § 1783 governs the subpoena s service f Issuing a Deposition Subpoena 1 Issuance A court order to take a deposition authorizes the clerk in the district where the deposition is to be taken to issue a subpoena for any witness named or described in the order 2 Place After considering the convenience of the witness and the parties the court may order — and the subpoena may require — the witness to appear anywhere the court designates g Contempt The court other than a magistrate judge may hold in contempt a witness who without

This rule is substantially the same as Rule 45 a of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [ 28 U S C Appendix ] Note to Subdivision b This rule preserves the existing right of an indigent defendant to secure attendance of witnesses at the expense of the Government 28 U S C [ former ] 656 Witnesses for indigent defendants Under existing law however the right is limited to witnesses who are within the district in which the court is held or within one hundred miles of the place of trial No procedure now exists whereby an indigent defendant can procure at Government expense the attendance of witnesses found in another district and more than 100 miles of the place of trial This limitation is abrogated by the rule so that an indigent defendant will be able to secure the attendance of witnesses at the expense of the Government no matter where they are located The showing required by the rule to justify such relief is the same as that now exacted by 28 U S C [ former ] 656 Note to Subdivision c This rule is substantially the same as Rule 45 b of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [ 28 U S C Appendix ] Note to Subdivision d This rule is substantially the same as Rule 45 c of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [ 28 U S C Appendix ] The provision permitting persons other than the marshal to serve the subpoena and requiring the payment of witness fees in Government cases is new matter Note to Subdivision e 1 This rule continues existing law 28 U S C [ former ] 654 Witnesses subpoenas may run into another district The rule is different in civil cases in that in such cases unless a statute otherwise provides a subpoena may be served only within the district or within 100 miles of the place of trial 28 U S C [ former ] 654 Rule 45 e 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [ 28 U S C Appendix ] Note to Subdivision e 2 This rule is substantially the same as Rule 45 e 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [ 28 U S C Appendix ] See Blackmer v United States 284 U S 421 upholding the validity of the statute referred to in the rule Note to Subdivision f This rule is substantially the same as Rule 45 d of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [ 28 U S C Appendix ] Note to Subdivision g This rule is substantially the same as Rule 45 f of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [ 28 U S C Appendix ] Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1948 Amendment The amendment is to substitute proper reference to Title 28 in place of the repealed act Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1966 Amendment Subdivision b — Criticism has been directed at the requirement that an indigent defendant disclose in advance the theory of his defense in order to obtain the issuance of a subpoena at government expense while the government and defendants able to pay may have subpoenas issued in blank without any disclosure See Report of the Attorney General s Committee on Poverty and the Administration of Criminal Justice 1963 p 27 The Attorney General s Committee also urged that the standard of financial inability to pay be substituted for that of indigency Id at 40 – 41 In one case it was held that the affidavit filed by an indigent defendant under this subdivision could be used by the government at his trial for purposes of impeachment Smith v United States 312 F 2d 867 D C Cir 1962 There has also been doubt as to whether the defendant need make a showing beyond the face of his affidavit in order to secure issuance of a subpoena Greenwell v United States 317 F 2d 108 D C Cir 1963 The amendment makes several changes The references to a judge are deleted since applications should be made to the court An ex parte application followed by a satisfactory showing is substituted for the requirement of a request or motion supported by affidavit The court is required to order the issuance of a subpoena upon finding that the defendant is unable to pay the witness fees and that the presence of the witness is necessary to an adequate defense Subdivision d — The subdivision is revised to bring it into conformity with 28 U S C § 1825 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1972 Amendment Subdivisions a and g are amended to reflect the existence of the United States magistrate a phrase defined in rule 54 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1974 Amendment Subdivision f 2 is amended to provide that the court has discretion over the place at which the deposition is to be taken Similar authority is conferred by Civil Rule 45 d 2 See C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure Criminal § 278 1969 Ordinarily the deposition should be taken at the place most convenient for the witness but under certain circumstances the parties may prefer to arrange for the presence of the witness at a place more convenient to counsel Notes of Committee on the Judiciary House Report No 94 – 247 1975 Amendment A Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court Rule 17 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deals with subpoenas Subdivision f 2 as proposed by the Supreme Court provides The witness whose deposition is to be taken may be required by subpoena to attend at any place designated by the trial court B Committee Action The Committee added language to the proposed amendment that directs the court to consider the convenience of the witness and the parties when compelling a witness to attend where a deposition will be taken Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1979 Amendment Note to Subdivision h This addition to rule 17 is necessary in light of proposed rule 26 2 which deals with the obtaining of statements of government and defense witnesses Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment The amendments are technical No substantive change is intended Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1993 Amendment The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [ P L 101 – 650 Title III Section 321 ] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28 United States Code shall be known as a United States magistrate judge Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 17 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only except as noted below A potential substantive change has been made in Rule 17 c 1 the word data has been added to the list of matters that may be subpoenaed The Committee believed that inserting that term will reflect the fact that in an increasingly technological culture the information may exist in a format not already covered by the more conventional list such as a book or document Rule 17 g has been amended to recognize the contempt powers of a court other than a magistrate judge and a magistrate judge Committee Notes on Rules — 2008 Amendment Subdivision c 3 This amendment implements the Crime Victims Rights Act codified at 18 U S C § 3771 a 8 which states that victims have a right to respect for their dignity and privacy The rule provides a protective mechanism when the defense subpoenas a third party to provide personal or confidential information about a victim Third party subpoenas raise special concerns because a third party may not assert the victim s interests and the victim may be unaware of the subpoena Accordingly the amendment requires judicial approval before service of a subpoena seeking personal or confidential information about a victim from a third party The phrase personal or confidential information which may include such things as medical or school records is left to case development The amendment provides a mechanism for notifying the victim and makes it clear that a victim may move to quash or modify the subpoena under Rule 17 c 2 — or object by other means such as a letter — on the grounds that it is unreasonable or oppressive The rule recognizes however that there may be exceptional circumstances in which this procedure may not be appropriate Such exceptional circumstances would include evidence that might be lost or destroyed if the subpoena were delayed or a situation where the defense would be unfairly prejudiced by premature disclosure of a sensitive defense strategy The Committee leaves to the judgment of the court a determination as to whether the judge will permit the question whether such exceptional circumstances exist to be decided ex parte and authorize service of the third party subpoena without notice to anyone The amendment applies only to subpoenas served after a complaint indictment or information has been filed It has no application to grand jury subpoenas When the grand jury seeks the production of personal or confidential information grand jury secrecy affords substantial protection for the victim s privacy and dignity interests Changes Made to Proposed Amendment Released for Public Comment The proposed amendment omits the language providing for ex parte issuance of a court order authorizing a subpoena to a third party for private or confidential information about a victim The last sentence of the amendment was revised to provide that unless there are exceptional circumstances the court must give the victim notice before a subpoena seeking the victim s personal or confidential information can be served upon a third party It was also revised to add the language or otherwise object to make it clear that the victim s objection might be lodged by means other than a motion such as a letter to the court

Places as the Congress may by Law have directed Amendment VI provides In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed which district shall have been previously ascertained by law * * * 28 U S C former § 114 now §§ 1393 1441 provides All prosecutions for crimes or offenses shall be had within the division of such districts where the same were committed unless the court or the judge thereof upon the application of the defendant shall order the cause to be transferred for prosecution to another division of the district The word prosecutions as used in this statute does not include the finding and return of an indictment The prevailing practice of impaneling a grand jury for the entire district at a session in some division and of distributing the indictments among the divisions in which the offenses were committed is deemed proper and legal Salinger v Loisel 265 U S 224 237 The court stated that this practice is attended with real advantages The rule is a restatement of existing law and is intended to sanction the continuance of this practice For this reason the rule requires that only the trial be held in the division in which the offense was committed and permits other proceedings to be had elsewhere in the same district 2

The amendment eliminates the requirement that the prosecution shall be in a division in which the offense was committed and vests discretion in the court to fix the place of trial at any place within

282 9th Cir 1938 Cf Platt v Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co 376 U S 240 1964 The former requirement for venue within the division operated in an irrational fashion Divisions have been created in only half of the districts and the differentiation between those districts with and those without divisions often bears no relationship to comparative size or population In many districts a single judge is required to sit in several divisions and only brief and infrequent terms may be held in particular divisions As a consequence under the original rule there was often undue delay in the disposition of criminal cases — delay which was particularly serious with respect to defendants who had been unable to secure release on bail pending the holding of the next term of court If the court is satisfied that there exists in the place fixed for trial prejudice against the defendant so great as to render the trial unfair the court may of course fix another place of trial within the district if there be such where such prejudice does not exist Cf Rule 21 dealing with transfers between districts Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1979 Amendment This amendment is intended to eliminate an inconsistency between rule 18 which in its present form has been interpreted not to allow trial in a division other than that in which the offense was committed except as dictated by the convenience of the defendant and witnesses Dupoint v United States 388 F 2d 39 5th Cir 1968 and the Speedy Trial Act of 1974 This Act provides In any case involving a defendant charged with an offense the appropriate judicial officer at the earliest practicable time shall after consultation with the counsel for the defendant and the attorney for the Government set the case for trial on a day certain or list it for trial on a weekly or other short term trial calendar at a place within the judicial district so as to assure a speedy trial 18 U S C § 3161 a This provision is intended to permit the trial of a case at any place within the judicial district This language was included in anticipation of problems which might occur in districts with statutory divisions where it could be difficult to set trial outside the division H R Rep No 93 – 1508 93d Cong 2d Sess 29 1974 The change does not offend the venue or vicinage provisions of the Constitution Article III § 2 clause 3 places venue the geographical location of the trial in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed while the Sixth Amendment defines the vicinage the geographical location of the jurors as the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed which district shall have been previously ascertained by law The latter provision makes no reference to a division within a judicial district United States v James 528 F 2d 999 5th Cir 1976 It follows a fortiori that when a district is not separated into divisions * * * trial at any place within the district is allowable under the Sixth Amendment * * * United States v Fernandez 480 F 2d 726 2d Cir 1973 See also Zicarelli v Gray 543 F 2d 466 3d Cir 1976 and cases cited therein Nor is the change inconsistent with the Declaration of Policy in the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968 which reads It is the policy of the United States that all litigants in Federal courts entitled to trial by jury shall have the right to grand and petit juries selected at random from a fair cross section of the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes 28 U S C § 1861 This language does not mean that the Act requires the trial court to convene not only in the district but also in the division wherein the offense occurred as There is no hint in the statutory history that the Jury Selection Act was intended to do more than provide improved judicial machinery so that grand and petit jurors would be selected at random by the use of objective qualification criteria to ensure a representative cross section of the district or division in which the grand or petit jury sits United States v Cates 485 F 2d 26 1st Cir 1974 The amendment to rule 18 does not eliminate either of the existing considerations which bear upon fixing the place of trial within a district but simply adds yet another consideration in the interest of ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974 The amendment does not authorize the fixing of the place of trial for yet other reasons Cf United States v Fernandez 480 F 2d 726 2d Cir 1973 court in the exercise of its supervisory power held improper the fixing of the place of trial for no apparent reason other than the convenience of the judge Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 18 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only Committee Notes on Rules — 2008 Amendment The rule requires the court to consider the convenience of victims — as well as the defendant and witnesses — in setting the place for trial within the district The Committee recognizes that the court has substantial discretion to balance any competing interests Changes Made to Proposed Amendment Released for Public Comment There were no changes in the text of the rule The Committee Note was amended to delete a statutory reference that commentators found misleading and to draw attention to the court s discretion to balance the competing interests which may be more important as the court must consider a new set of interests Rule 19 [ Reserved ] Rule 20 Transfer for Plea and Sentence a Consent to Transfer A prosecution may be transferred from the district where the indictment or information is pending or from which a warrant on a complaint has been issued to the district where the defendant is arrested held or present if 1 the defendant states in writing a wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere and to waive trial in the district where the indictment information or complaint is pending consents in writing to the court s disposing of the case in the transferee district and files the statement in the transferee district and 2 the United States attorneys in both districts approve the transfer in writing b Clerk s Duties After receiving the defendant s statement and the required approvals the clerk where the indictment information or complaint is pending must send the file or a certified copy to the clerk in the transferee district c Effect of a Not Guilty Plea If the defendant pleads not guilty after the case has been transferred under Rule 20 a the clerk must return the papers to the court where the prosecution began and that court must restore the proceeding to its docket The defendant s statement that the defendant wished to plead guilty or nolo contendere is not in any civil or criminal proceeding admissible against the defendant d Juveniles 1 Consent to Transfer A juvenile as defined in 18 U S C § 5031 may be proceeded against as a juvenile delinquent in the district where the juvenile is arrested held or present if A the alleged offense that occurred in the other district is not punishable by death or life imprisonment B an attorney has advised the juvenile C the court has informed the juvenile of the juvenile s rights — including the right to be returned to the district where the offense allegedly occurred — and the consequences of waiving those rights D the juvenile

Committee on Rules — 1944 This rule introduces a new procedure in the interest of defendants who intend to plead guilty and are arrested in a district other than that in which the prosecution has been instituted This rule would accord to a defendant in such a situation an opportunity to secure a disposition of the case in the district where the arrest takes place thereby relieving him of whatever hardship may be involved in a removal to the place where the prosecution is pending In order to prevent possible interference with the administration of justice however the consent of the United States attorneys involved is required Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1966 Amendment Rule 20 has proved to be most useful In some districts however literal compliance with the procedures spelled out by the rule has resulted in unnecessary delay in the disposition of cases This delay has been particularly troublesome where the defendant has been arrested prior to the filing of an indictment or information against him See e g the procedure described in Donovan v United States 205 F 2d 557 10th Cir 1953 Furthermore the benefit of the rule has not been available to juveniles electing to be proceeded against under 18 U S C §§ 5031 – 5037 In an attempt to clarify and simplify the procedure the rule has been recast into four subdivisions Subdivision a — This subdivision is intended to apply to the situation in which an indictment or information is pending at the time at which the defendant indicates his desire to have the transfer made Two amendments are made to the present language of the rule In the first sentence the words or held and or is held are added to make it clear that a person already in state or federal custody within a district may request a transfer of federal charges pending against him in another district See 4 Barron Federal Practice and Procedure 146 1951 The words after receiving a copy of the indictment or information are deleted The defendant should be permitted if he wishes to initiate transfer proceedings under the Rule without waiting for a copy of the indictment or information to be obtained The defendant is protected against prejudice by the fact that under subdivision c he can in effect rescind his action by pleading not guilty after the transfer has been completed Subdivision b — This subdivision is intended to apply to the situation in which no indictment or information is pending but the defendant has been arrested on a warrant issued upon a complaint in another district Under the procedure set out he may initiate the transfer proceedings without waiting for the filing of an indictment or information in the district where the complaint is pending Also it is made clear that the defendant may validate an information previously filed by waiving indictment in open court when he is brought before the court to plead See United States v East 5 F R D 389 N D Ind 1946 Potter v United States 36 F R D 394 W D Mo 1965 Here again the defendant is fully protected by the fact that at the time of pleading in the transferee court he may then refuse to waive indictment and rescind the transfer by pleading not guilty Subdivision c — The last two sentences of the original rule are included here The last sentence is amended to forbid use against the defendant of his statement that he wishes to plead guilty or nolo contendere whether or not he was represented by counsel when it was made Since under the amended rule the defendant may make his statement prior to receiving a copy of the indictment or information it would be unfair to permit use of that statement against him Subdivision d — Under 18 U S C § 5033 a juvenile who has committed an act in violation of the law of the United States in one district and is apprehended in another must be returned to the district having cognizance of the alleged violation before he can consent to being proceeded against as a juvenile delinquent This subdivision will permit a juvenile after he has been advised by counsel and with the approval of the court and the United States attorney to consent to be proceeded against in the district in which he is arrested or held Consent is required only of the United States attorney in the district of the arrest in order to permit expeditious handling of juvenile cases If it is necessary to recognize special interests of particular districts where offenses are committed — e g the District of Columbia with its separate Juvenile Court District of Columbia Code § 11 – 1551 a — the Attorney General may do so through his Administrative control over United States Attorneys Subdivision e — This subdivision is added to make it clear that a defendant who appears in one district in response to a summons issued in the district where the offense was committed may initiate transfer proceedings under the rule Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1974 Amendment Rule 20 is amended to provide that a person present in a district other than the district in which he is charged with a criminal offense may subject to the other provisions of rule 20 plead guilty in the district in which he is present See rule 6 b Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Minor Offenses Before Magistrates Under the former rule practice was to have the district in which the offense occurred issue a bench warrant authorizing the arrest of the defendant in the district in which he was located This is a procedural complication which serves no interest of either the government or the defense and therefore can properly be dispensed with Making the fact that a defendant is present in the district an adequate basis for allowing him to plead guilty there makes it unnecessary to retain subdivision e which makes appearance in response to a summons equivalent to an arrest Dropping e will eliminate some minor ambiguity created by that subdivision See C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure Criminal § 322 n 26 p 612 1969 Supp 1971 There are practical advantages which will follow from the change In practice a person may turn himself in in a district other than that in which the prosecution is pending It may be more convenient to have him plead in the district in which he is present rather than having him or the government incur the expense of his return to the district in which the charge is pending The danger of forum shopping can be controlled by the requirement that both United States Attorneys agree to the handling of the case under provisions of this rule Notes of Committee on the Judiciary House Report No 94 – 247 1975 Amendment A Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court Rule 20 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deals with transferring a defendant from one district to another for the purpose of pleading and being sentenced It deals with the situation where a defendant is located in one district A and is charged with a crime in another district B Under the present rule if such a defendant desires to waive trial and plead guilty or nolo contendere a judge in district B would issue a bench warrant for the defendant authorizing his arrest in district A and his transport to district B for the purpose of pleading and being sentenced The Supreme Court amendments permit the defendant in the above example to plead guilty or nolo contendere in district A if the United States Attorneys for districts A and B consent B Committee Action The Committee has added a conforming amendment to subdivision d which establishes procedures for dealing with defendants who are juveniles Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1982 Amendment This amendment to subdivision b is intended to expedite transfer proceedings under Rule 20 At present considerable delay — sometimes as long as three or four weeks — occurs in subdivision b cases that is where no indictment or information is pending This time is spent on the transmittal of defendant s statement to the district where the complaint is pending the filing of an information or return of an indictment there and the transmittal of papers in the case from that district to the district where the defendant is present Under the amendment the defendant by also waiving venue would make it possible for charges to be filed in the district of his arrest or presence This would advance the interests of both the prosecution and defendant in a timely entry of a plea of guilty No change has been made in the requirement that the transfer occur with the consent of both United States attorneys Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment The amendments are technical No substantive change is intended Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 20 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only except as noted below New Rule 20 d 2 applies to juvenile cases and has been added to parallel a similar provision in new Rule 20 b The new provision provides that after the court has determined that the provisions in Rule 20 d 1 have been completed and the transfer is approved the file or certified copy must be transmitted from the original court to the transferee court Amendment by Public Law 1975 — Subd d Pub L 94 – 64

with Federal practice are somewhat astounded to learn that they may not move for a change of venue even if they are able to demonstrate that public feeling in the vicinity of the crime may render impossible a fair and impartial trial This seems to be a defect in the federal law which the proposed rules would cure Homer Cummings 29 A B A Jour 655 Medalie 4 Lawyers Guild R 3 1 5 2 The rule provides for two kinds of motions that may be made by the defendant for a change of venue The first is a motion on the ground that so great a prejudice exists against the defendant that he cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial in the district or division where the case is pending Express provisions to a similar effect are found in many State statutes See e g Ala Code 1940 Title 15 sec 267 Cal Pen Code Deering 1941 sec 1033 Conn Gen Stat 1930 sec 6445 Mass Gen Laws 1932 c 277 sec 51 in capital cases N Y Code of Criminal Procedure sec 344 The second is a motion for a change of venue in cases involving an offense alleged to have been committed in more than one district or division In such cases the court on defendant s motion will be authorized to transfer the case to another district or division in which the commission of the offense is charged if the court is satisfied that it is in the interest of justice to do so The effect of this provision would be to modify the existing practice under which in such cases the Government has the final choice of the jurisdiction where the prosecution should be conducted The matter will now be left in the discretion of the court 3 The rule provides for a change of venue only on defendant s motion and does not extend the same right to the prosecution since the defendant has a constitutional right to a trial in the district where the offense was committed Constitution of the United States Article III Sec 2 Par 3 Amendment VI By making a motion for a change of venue however the defendant waives this constitutional right 4 This rule is in addition to and does not supersede existing statutes enabling a party to secure a change of judge on the ground of personal bias or prejudice 28 U S C 25 [ now 144 ] or enabling the

Amendment Subdivision a — All references to divisions are eliminated in accordance with the amendment to Rule 18 eliminating division venue The defendant is given the right to a transfer only when he can show that he cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial at any place fixed by law for holding court in the district Transfers within the district to avoid prejudice will be within the power of the judge to fix the place of trial as provided in the amendments to Rule 18 It is also made clear that on a motion to transfer under this subdivision the court may select the district to which the

trial the trial must be by jury unless 1 the defendant waives a jury trial in writing 2 the government consents and 3 the court approves Jury Size 1 In General A jury consists of 12 persons unless this rule provides otherwise 2 Stipulation for a Smaller Jury At any time before the verdict the parties may with the court s approval stipulate in writing that A the jury may consist of fewer than 12 persons or B a jury of fewer than 12 persons may return a verdict if the court finds it necessary to excuse a juror for good cause after the trial begins 3 Court Order for a Jury of 11 After the jury has retired to deliberate the court may permit a jury of 11 persons to return a verdict even without a stipulation by the parties if the court finds good cause to excuse a juror c Nonjury Trial In a case tried without a jury the court must find the defendant guilty or not guilty If a party requests before the finding of guilty or not guilty the court must state its specific findings of fact in

trial that the case be tried by a jury composed of less than 12 or a stipulation during the trial consenting that the case be submitted to less than 12 jurors The second alternative is useful in case it becomes necessary during the trial to excuse a juror owing to illness or for some other cause and no alternate juror is available The rule is a restatement of existing practice the constitutionality of which was approved in Patton v United States 281 U S 276 Note to Subdivision c This rule changes existing law in so far as it requires the court in a case tried without a jury to make special findings of fact if requested Cf Connecticut practice under which a judge in a criminal case tried by the court without a jury makes findings of fact State v Frost 105 Conn 326 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1966 Amendment This amendment adds to the rule a provision added to Civil Rule 52 a in 1946 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1977 Amendment The amendment to subdivision b makes it clear that the parties with the approval of the court may enter into an agreement to have the case decided by less than twelve jurors if one or more jurors are unable or disqualified to continue For many years the Eastern District of Virginia has used a form entitled Waiver of Alternate Jurors In a substantial percentage of cases the form is signed by the defendant his attorney and the Assistant United States Attorney in advance of trial generally on the morning of trial It is handled automatically by the courtroom deputy clerk who after completion exhibits it to the judge This practice would seem to be authorized by existing rule 23 b but there has been some doubt as to whether the pretrial stipulation is effective unless again agreed to by a defendant at the time a juror or jurors have to be excused See 8 J Moore Federal Practice 23 04 2d ed Cipes 1969 C Wright Federal Practice and Procedure Criminal § 373 1969 The proposed amendment is intended to make clear that the pretrial stipulation is an effective waiver which need not be renewed at the time the incapacity or disqualification of the juror becomes known In view of the fact that a defendant can make an effective pretrial waiver of trial by jury or by a jury of twelve it would seem to follow that he can also effectively waive trial by a jury of twelve in situations where a juror or jurors cannot continue to serve As has been the practice under rule 23 b a stipulation addressed to the possibility that some jurors may later be excused need not be open ended That is the stipulation may be conditioned upon the jury not being reduced below a certain size See e g Williams v United States 332 F 2d 36 7th Cir 1964 agreement to proceed if no more than 2 jurors excused for illness Rogers v United States 319 F 2d 5 7th Cir 1963 same Subdivision c is changed to make clear the deadline for making a request for findings of fact and to provide that findings may be oral The oral findings of course become a part of the record as findings of fact are essential to proper appellate review on a conviction resulting from a nonjury trial United States v Livingston 459 F 2d 797 3d Cir 1972 The meaning of current subdivision c has been in some doubt because there is no time specified within which a defendant must make a request that the court find the facts specially See e g United States v Rivera 444 F 2d 136 2d Cir 1971 where the request was not made until the sentence had been imposed In the opinion the court said This situation might have raised the interesting and apparently undecided question of when a request for findings under Fed R Crim P 23 c is too late since Rivera s request was not made until the day after sentence was imposed See generally Benchwick v United States 297 F 2d 330 335 9th Cir 1961 United States v Morris 263 F 2d 594 7th Cir 1959 Notes of Committee on the Judiciary Senate Report No 95 – 354 1977 Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court

Procedure to the Judicial Conference Congressional Approval of Proposed 1977 Amendments Pub L 95 – 78 § 2 b July 30 1977 91 Stat 320 provided that The amendments proposed by the Supreme Court [ in its order of Apr 26 1977 ] to subdivisions b and c of rule 23 of such Rules of Criminal Procedure [ subd b and c of this rule ] are approved Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1983 Amendment Note to Subdivision b The amendment to subdivision b addresses a situation which does not occur with great frequency but which when it does occur may present a most difficult issue concerning the fair and efficient administration of justice This situation is that in which after the jury has retired to consider its verdict and any alternate jurors have been discharged one of the jurors is seriously incapacitated or otherwise found to be unable to continue service upon the jury The problem is acute when the trial has been a lengthy one and consequently the remedy of mistrial would necessitate a second expenditure of substantial prosecution defense and court resources See e g United States v Meinster 484 F Supp 442 S D Fla 1980 aff d sub nom United States v Phillips 664 F 2d 971 5th Cir 1981 juror had heart attack during deliberations after well over four months of trial United States v Barone 83 F R D 565 S D Fla 1979 juror removed upon recommendation of psychiatrist during deliberations after approximately six months of trial It is the judgment of the Committee that when a juror is lost during deliberations especially in circumstances like those in Barone and Meinster it is essential that there be available a course of action other than mistrial Proceeding with the remaining 11 jurors though heretofore impermissible under rule 23 b absent stipulation by the parties and approval of the court United States v Taylor 507 F 2d 166 5th Cir 1975 is constitutionally permissible In Williams v Florida 399 U S 78 1970 the Court concluded the fact that the jury at common law was composed of precisely 12 is an historical accident unnecessary to effect the purposes of the jury system and wholly without significance except to mystics * * * To read the Sixth Amendment as forever codifying a feature so incidental to the real purpose of the Amendment is to ascribe a blind formalism to the Framers which would require considerably more evidence than we have been able to discover in the history and language of the Constitution or in the reasoning of our past decisions * * * Our holding does no more than leave these considerations to Congress and the States unrestrained by an interpretation of the Sixth Amendment which would forever dictate the precise number which can constitute a jury Williams held that a six person jury was constitutional because such a jury had the essential feature of a jury i e the interposition between the accused and his accuser of the common sense judgment of a group of laymen and in the community participation and shared responsibility which results from that group s determination of guilt or innocence necessitating only a group large enough to promote group deliberation free from outside attempts at intimidation and to provide a fair possibility for obtaining a representative cross section of the community This being the case quite clearly the occasional use of a jury of slightly less than 12 as contemplated by the amendment to rule 23 b is constitutional Though the alignment of the Court and especially the separate opinion by Justice Powell in Apodoca v Oregon 406 U S 404 1972 makes it at best uncertain whether less than unanimous verdicts would be constitutionally permissible in federal trials it hardly follows that a requirement of unanimity of a group slightly less than 12 is similarly suspect The Meinster case clearly reflects the need for a solution other than mistrial There twelve defendants were named in a 36 count 100 page indictment for RICO offenses and related violations and the trial lasted more than four months Before the jury retired for deliberations the trial judge inquired of defense counsel whether they would now agree to a jury of less than 12 should a juror later be unable to continue during the deliberations which were anticipated to be lengthy All defense counsel rejected that proposal When one juror was excused a day later after suffering a heart attack all defense counsel again rejected the proposal that deliberations continue with the remaining 11 jurors Thus the solution now provided in rule 23 b stipulation to a jury of less than 12 was not possible in that case just as it will not be possible in any case in which defense counsel believe some tactical advantage will be gained by retrial Yet to declare a mistrial at that point would have meant that over four months of trial time would have gone for naught and that a comparable period of time would have to be expended on retrial For a variety of reasons not the least of which is the impact such a retrial would have upon that court s ability to comply with speedy trial limits in other cases such a result is most undesirable That being the case it is certainly understandable that the trial judge in Meinster as in Barone elected to substitute an alternate juror at that point Given the rule 23 b bar on a verdict of less than 12 absent stipulation United States v Taylor supra such substitution seemed the least objectionable course of action But in terms of what change in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is to be preferred in order to facilitate response to such situations in the future the judgment of the Advisory Committee is that it is far better to permit the deliberations to continue with a jury of 11 than to make a substitution at that point In rejecting the substitution of juror alternative the Committee s judgment is in accord with that of most commentators and many courts There have been proposals that the rule should be amended to permit an alternate to be substituted if a regular juror becomes unable to perform his duties after the case has been submitted to the jury An early draft of the original Criminal Rules had contained such a provision but it was withdrawn when the Supreme Court itself indicated to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules doubts as to the desirability and constitutionality of such a procedure These doubts are as forceful now as they were a quarter century ago To permit substitution of an alternate after deliberations have begun would require either that the alternate participate though he has missed part of the jury discussion or that he sit in with the jury in every case on the chance he might be needed Either course is subject to practical difficulty and to strong constitutional objection Wright Federal Practice and Procedure § 388 1969 See also Moore Federal Practice par 24 05 2d ed Cipes 1980 The inherent coercive effect upon an alternate who joins a jury leaning heavily toward a guilty verdict may result in the alternate reaching a premature guilty verdict 3 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice § 15 – 2 7 commentary 2d ed 1980 It is not desirable to allow a juror who is unfamiliar with the prior deliberations to suddenly join the group and participate in the voting without the benefit of earlier group discussion United States v Lamb 529 F 2d 1153 9th Cir 1975 People v Ryan 19 N Y 2d 100 224 N E 2d 710 1966 Compare People v Collins 17 Cal 3d 687 131 Cal Rptr 782 522 P 2d 742 1976 Johnson v State 267 Ind 256 396 N E 2d 623 1977 The central difficulty with substitution whether viewed only as a practical problem or a question of constitutional dimensions procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment or jury trial under the Sixth Amendment is that there does not appear to be any way to nullify the impact of what has occurred without the participation of the new juror Even were it required that the jury review with the new juror their prior deliberations or that the jury upon substitution start deliberations anew it still seems likely that the continuing jurors would be influenced by the earlier deliberations and that the new juror would be somewhat intimidated by the others by virtue of being a newcomer to the deliberations As for the possibility of sending in the alternates at the very beginning with instructions to listen but not to participate until substituted this scheme is likewise attended by practical difficulties and offends the cardinal principle that the deliberations of the jury shall remain private and secret in every case United States v Virginia Erection Corp 335 F 2d 868 4th Cir 1964 The amendment provides that if a juror is excused after the jury has retired to consider its verdict it is within the discretion of the court whether to declare a mistrial or to permit deliberations to continue with 11 jurors If the trial has been brief and not much would be lost by retrial the court might well conclude that the unusual step of allowing a jury verdict by less than 12 jurors absent stipulation should not be taken On the other hand if the trial has been protracted the court is much more likely to opt for continuing with the remaining 11 jurors Committee

Retaining Alternate Jurors The court may retain alternate jurors after the jury retires to deliberate The court must ensure that a retained alternate does not discuss the case with anyone until that alternate replaces a juror or is discharged If an alternate replaces a juror after deliberations have begun the court must instruct the jury to begin its deliberations anew 4 Peremptory Challenges Each side is entitled to the number of additional peremptory challenges to prospective alternate jurors specified below These additional challenges may be used only to remove alternate jurors A One or Two Alternates One additional peremptory challenge is permitted when one or two alternates are impaneled B Three or Four Alternates Two additional peremptory challenges are permitted when three or

the United States so that both sides have 20 challenges which only the defendant has at present While continuing the existing rule that multiple defendants are deemed a single party for purposes of challenges the rule vests in the court discretion to allow additional peremptory challenges to multiple defendants and to permit such challenges to be exercised separately or jointly Experience with

and shall not take effect Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment The amendments are technical No substantive change is intended Committee Notes on Rules — 1999 Amendment As currently written Rule 24 c explicitly requires the court to discharge all of the alternate jurors — who have not been selected to replace other jurors — when the jury retires to deliberate That requirement is grounded on the concern that after the case has been submitted to the jury its deliberations must be private and inviolate United States v Houlihan 92 F 3d 1271 1285 1st Cir 1996 citing United States v Virginia Election Corp 335 F 2d 868 872 4th Cir 1964 Rule 23 b provides that in some circumstances a verdict may be returned by eleven jurors In addition there may be cases where it is better to retain the alternates when the jury retires insulate them from the deliberation process and have them available should one or more vacancies occur in the jury That might be especially appropriate in a long costly and complicated case To that end the Committee believed that the court should have the discretion to decide whether to retain or discharge the alternates at the time the jury retires to deliberate and to use Rule 23 b to proceed with eleven jurors or to substitute a juror or jurors with alternate jurors who have not been discharged In order to protect the sanctity of the deliberative process the rule requires the court to take appropriate steps to insulate the alternate jurors That may be done for example by separating the alternates from the deliberating jurors and instructing the alternate jurors not to discuss the case with any other person until they replace a regular juror See e g United States v Olano 507 U S 725 1993 not plain error to permit alternate jurors to sit in during deliberations United States v Houlihan 92 F 3d 1271 1286 – 88 1st Cir 1996 harmless error to retain alternate jurors in violation of Rule 24 c in finding harmless error the court cited the steps taken by the trial judge to insulate the alternates If alternates are used the jurors must be instructed that they must begin their deliberations anew Finally subsection c has been reorganized and restyled GAP Report — Rule 24 c The final sentence of Rule 24 c was moved from the committee note to the rule to emphasize that if an alternate replaces a juror during deliberations the court shall instruct the jury to begin its deliberations anew Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 24 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only except as noted below In restyling Rule 24 a the Committee deleted the language that authorized the defendant to conduct voir dire of prospective jurors The Committee believed that the current language was potentially ambiguous and could lead one incorrectly to conclude that a defendant represented by counsel could personally conduct voir dire or additional voir dire The Committee believed that the intent of the current provision was to permit a defendant to participate personally in voir dire only if the defendant was acting pro se Amended Rule 24 a refers only to attorneys for the parties i e the defense counsel and the attorney for the government with the understanding that if the defendant is not represented by counsel the court may still in its discretion permit the defendant to participate in voir dire In summary the Committee intends no change in practice Finally the rule authorizes the court in multi defendant cases to grant additional peremptory challenges to the defendants If the court does so the prosecution may request additional challenges in a multi defendant case not to exceed the total number available to the defendants jointly The court however is not required to equalize the number of challenges where additional challenges are granted to the defendant Rule 25 Judge s Disability a During Trial Any judge regularly sitting in or assigned to the court may complete a jury trial if 1 the judge before whom the trial began cannot proceed because of death sickness or other disability and 2 the judge completing the trial certifies familiarity with the trial record b After a Verdict or Finding of Guilty 1 In General After a verdict or finding of guilty any judge regularly sitting in or assigned to a court may complete the court s duties if the judge who presided at trial cannot perform those duties because of absence death sickness or other disability 2 Granting a New Trial The successor judge may grant a new trial if satisfied that A a judge other than the one who presided at the trial cannot perform the post trial duties or B a new trial is necessary for some other reason As amended Feb 28 1966 eff July 1 1966 Mar 9 1987 eff Aug 1 1987 Apr 29 2002 eff Dec 1 2002 Notes of Advisory

judge Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1966 Amendment In September 1963 the Judicial Conference of the United States approved a recommendation of its Committee on Court Administration that provision be made for substitution of a judge who becomes disabled during trial The problem has become serious because of the increase in the number of long criminal trials See 1963 Annual Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts p 114 reporting a 25 % increase in criminal trials lasting more than one week in fiscal year 1963 over 1962 Subdivision a — The

situations where a judge who has been assigned from within the district to try the case is at the time for sentence etc back at his regular place of holding court which may be several hundred miles

Rule 25 b 2 addresses the possibility of a new trial when a judge determines that no other judge could perform post trial duties or when the judge determines that there is some other reason for doing so The current rule indicates that those reasons must be appropriate The Committee however believed that a better term would be necessary because that term includes notions of manifest necessity No change in meaning or practice is intended Rule 26 Taking Testimony In every trial the testimony of witnesses must be taken in open court unless otherwise provided by a statute or by rules adopted

of rules of evidence to be applicable in trials of criminal cases in the Federal courts It is based on Funk v United States 290 U S 371 and Wolfle v United States 291 U S 7 which indicated that in the absence of statute the Federal courts in criminal cases are not bound by the State law of evidence but are guided by common law principles as interpreted by the Federal courts in the light of reason and experience The rule does not fetter the applicable law of evidence to that originally existing at common law It is contemplated that the law may be modified and adjusted from time to time by judicial decisions See Homer Cummings 29 A B A Jour 655 Vanderbilt 29 A B A Jour 377 Holtzoff 12 George Washington L R 119 131 – 132 Holtzoff 3 F R D 445 453 Howard 51 Yale L Jour 763 Medalie 4 Lawyers Guild R 3 1 5 – 6 2 This rule differs from the corresponding rule for civil cases Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 43 a [ 28 U S C Appendix ] in that this rule contemplates a uniform body of rules of evidence to govern in criminal trials in the Federal courts while the rule for civil cases prescribes partial conformity to State law and therefore results in a divergence as between various districts Since in civil actions in which Federal jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship the State substantive law governs the rights of the parties uniformity of rules of evidence among different districts does not appear necessary On the other hand since all Federal crimes are statutory and all criminal prosecutions in the Federal courts are based on acts of Congress uniform rules of evidence appear desirable if not essential in criminal cases as otherwise the same facts under differing rules of evidence may lead to a conviction in one district and to an acquittal in another 3 This rule expressly continues existing statutes governing the admissibility of evidence and the competency and privileges of witnesses Among such statutes are the following U S C Title 8 Section 138 [ see 1326 1328 1329 ] Importation of aliens for immoral purposes attempt to re enter after deportation penalty U S C Title 28 Section 632 [ now 18 U S C 3481 ] Competency of witnesses

Criminal Procedure did not contain a provision explicitly regulating the determination of foreign law The resolution of issues of foreign law when relevant in federal criminal proceedings falls within the general compass of Rule 26 which provides for application of the [ evidentiary ] principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience See Green Preliminary Report on the Advisability and Feasibility of Developing Uniform Rules of Evidence for the United States District Courts 6 – 7 17 – 18 1962 Although traditional commonlaw methods for determining foreign country law have proved inadequate the courts have not developed more appropriate practices on the basis of this flexible rule Cf Green op cit supra at 26 – 28 On the inadequacy of common law procedures for determining foreign law see e g Nussbaum Proving the Law of Foreign Countries 3 Am J Comp L 60 1954 Problems of foreign law that must be resolved in accordance with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are most likely to arise in places such as Washington D C the Canal Zone Guam and the Virgin Islands where the federal courts have general criminal jurisdiction However issues of foreign law may also arise in criminal proceedings commenced in other federal districts For example in an extradition proceeding reasonable ground to believe that the person sought to be extradited is charged with or was convicted of a crime under the laws of the demanding state must generally be shown See Factor v Laubenheimer 290 U S 276 1933 Fernandez v Phillips 268 U S 311 1925 Bishop International Law Cases and Materials 2d ed 1962 Further foreign law may be invoked to justify non compliance with a subpoena duces tecum Application of Chase

relevant in proceedings arising under 18 U S C §§ 1201 2312 – 2317 Rule 26 1 is substantially the same as Civil Rule 44 1 A full explanation of the merits and practicability of the rule appear in the Advisory Committee s Note to Civil Rule 44 1 It is necessary here to add only one comment to the explanations there made The second sentence of the rule frees the court from the restraints of the ordinary rules of evidence in determining foreign law This freedom made necessary by the peculiar nature of the issue of foreign law should not constitute an unconstitutional deprivation of the defendant s rights to confrontation of witnesses The issue is essentially one of law rather than of fact Furthermore the cases have held that the Sixth Amendment does not serve as a rigid barrier against the development of reasonable and necessary exceptions to the hearsay rule See Kay v United States 255 F 2d 476 480 4th Cir 1958 cert den 358 U S 825 1958 Matthews v United States 217 F 2d 409

a Motion to Produce After a witness other than the defendant has testified on direct examination the court on motion of a party who did not call the witness must order an attorney for the government or the defendant and the defendant s attorney to produce for the examination and use of the moving party any statement of the witness that is in their possession and that relates to the subject matter of the witness s testimony b Producing the Entire Statement If the entire statement relates to the subject matter of the witness s testimony the court must order that the statement be delivered to the moving party c Producing a Redacted Statement If the party who called the witness claims that the statement contains information that is privileged or does not relate to the subject matter of the witness s testimony the court must inspect the statement in camera After excising any privileged or unrelated portions the court must order delivery of the redacted statement to the moving party If the defendant objects to an excision the court must preserve the entire statement with the excised portion indicated under seal as part of the record d Recess to Examine a Statement The court may recess the proceedings to allow time for a party to examine the statement and prepare for its use e Sanction for Failure to Produce or Deliver a Statement If the party who called the witness disobeys an order to produce or deliver a statement the court must strike the witness s testimony from the record If an attorney for the government disobeys the order the court must declare a mistrial if justice so requires f As used in this rule a witness s statement means 1 a written statement that the witness makes and signs or otherwise adopts or approves 2 a substantially verbatim contemporaneously recorded recital of the witness s oral statement that is contained in any recording or any transcription of a recording or 3 the witness s statement to a grand jury however taken or recorded or a transcription of such a statement g Scope This rule applies at trial at a suppression hearing under Rule 12 and to the extent specified in the following rules 1 Rule 5 1 h preliminary

1437 95th Cong 1st Sess 1977 would place in the criminal rules the substance of what is now 18 U S C § 3500 the Jencks Act Underlying this and certain other additions to the rules contemplated by S 1437 is the notion that provisions which are purely procedural in nature should appear in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure rather than in Title 18 See Reform of the Federal Criminal Laws Part VI Hearings on S 1 S 716 and S 1400 Subcomm on Criminal Laws and Procedures Senate Judiciary Comm 93rd Cong 1st Sess statement of Judge Albert B Maris at page 5503 Rule 26 2 is identical to the S 1437 rule except as indicated by the marked additions and deletions As those changes show rule 26 2 provides for production of the statements of defense witnesses at trial in essentially the same manner as is now provided for with respect to the statements of government witnesses Thus the proposed rule reflects these two judgments i that the subject matter — production of the statements of witnesses — is more appropriately dealt with in the criminal rules and ii that in light of United States v Nobles 422 U S 225 1975 it is important to establish procedures for the production of defense witnesses statements as well The rule is not intended to discourage the practice of voluntary disclosure at an earlier time so as to avoid delays at trial In Nobles defense counsel sought to introduce the testimony of a defense investigator who prior to trial had interviewed prospective prosecution witnesses and had prepared a report embodying the essence of their conversation When the defendant called the investigator to impeach eyewitness testimony identifying the defendant as the robber the trial judge granted the prosecutor the right to inspect those portions of the investigator s report relating to the witnesses statements as a potential basis for cross examination of the investigator When the defense declined to produce the report the trail judge refused to permit the investigator to testify The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the trail court s actions finding that neither the Fifth nor Sixth Amendments nor the attorney work product doctrine prevented disclosure of such a document at trial Noting the federal judiciary s inherent power to require the prosecution to produce the previously recorded statements of its witnesses so that the defense may get the full benefit of cross examinations and the truth finding process may be enhanced the Court rejected the notion that the Fifth amendment renders criminal discovery basically a one way street and thus concluded that in a proper case the prosecution can call upon that same power for production of witness statements that facilitate full disclosure of all the [ relevant ] facts The rule consistent with the reasoning in Nobles is designed to place the disclosure of prior relevant statements of a defense witness in the possession of the defense on the same legal footing as is the disclosure of prior statements of prosecution witnesses in the hands of the government under the Jencks Act 18 U S C § 3500 which S 1437 would replace with the rule set out therein See United States v Pulvirenti 408 F Supp 12 E D Mich 1976 holding that under Nobles [ t ] he obligation [ of disclosure ] placed on the defendant should be the reciprocal of that placed upon the government * * * [ as ] defined by the Jencks Act Several state courts have likewise concluded that witness statements in the hands of the defense at trial should be disclosed on the same basis that prosecution witness statements are disclosed in order to promote the concept of the trail as a search for truth See e g People v Sanders 110 Ill App 2d 85 249 N E 2d 124 1969 State v Montague 55 N J 371 262 A 2d 398 1970 People v Damon 24 N Y 2d 256 299 N Y S 2d 830 247 N E 2d 651 1959 The rule with minor exceptions makes the procedure identical for both prosecution and defense witnesses including the provision directing the court whenever a claim is made that disclosure would be improper because the statement contains irrelevant matter to examine the statements in camera and excise such matter as should not be disclosed This provision acts as a safeguard against abuse and will enable a defendant who believes that a demand is being improperly made to secure a swift and just resolution of the issue The treatment as to defense witnesses of necessity differs slightly from the treatment as to prosecution witnesses in terms of the sanction for a refusal to comply with the court s disclosure order Under the Jencks Act and the rule proposed in S 1437 if the prosecution refuses to abide by the court s order the court is required to strike the witness s testimony unless in its discretion it determines that the more serious sanction of a mistrial in favor of the accused is warranted Under this rule if a defendant refuses to comply with the court s disclosure order the court s only alternative is to enter an order striking or precluding the testimony of the witness as was done in Nobles Under subdivision a of the rule the motion for production may be made by a party who did not call the witness Thus it also requires disclosure of statements in the possession of either party when the witness is called neither by the prosecution nor the defense but by the court pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence Present law does not deal with this situation which consistency requires be treated in an identical manner as the disclosure of statements of witnesses called by a party to the case Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment The amendments are technical No substantive change is intended Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1993 Amendment New subdivision g recognizes other contemporaneous amendments in the Rules of Criminal Procedure which extend the application of Rule 26 2 to other proceedings Those changes are thus consistent with the extension of Rule 26 2 in 1983 to suppression hearings conducted under Rule 12 See Rule 12 i In extending Rule 26 2 to suppression hearings in 1983 the Committee offered several reasons First production of witness statements enhances the ability of the court to assess the witnesses credibility and thus assists the court in making accurate factual determinations at suppression hearings Second because witnesses testifying at a suppression hearing may not necessarily testify at the trial itself waiting until after a witness testifies at trial before requiring production of that witness s statement would be futile Third the Committee believed that it would be feasible to leave the suppression issue open until trial where Rule 26 2 would then be applicable Finally one of the central reasons for requiring production of statements at suppression hearings was the recognition that by its nature the results of a suppression hearing have a profound and ultimate impact on the issues presented at trial The reasons given in 1983 for extending Rule 26 2 to a suppression hearing are equally compelling with regard to other adversary type hearings which ultimately depend on accurate and reliable information That is there is a continuing need for information affecting the credibility of witnesses who present testimony And that need exists without regard to whether the witness is presenting testimony at a pretrial hearing at a trial or at a post trial proceeding As noted in the 1983 Advisory Committee Note to Rule 12 i the courts have generally declined to extend the Jencks Act 18 U S C § 3500 beyond the confines of actual trial testimony That result will be obviated by the addition of Rule 26 2 g and amendments to the Rules noted in that new subdivision Although amendments to Rules 32 32 1 46 and Rule 8 of the Rules Governing Proceedings under 28 U S C § 2255 specifically address the requirement of producing a witness s statement Rule 26 2 has become known as the central rule requiring production of statements Thus the references in the Rule itself will assist the bench and bar in locating other Rules which include similar provisions The amendment to Rule 26 2 and the other designated Rules is not intended to require production of a witness s statement before the witness actually testifies Minor conforming amendments have been made to subsection d to reflect that Rule 26 2 will be applicable to proceedings other than the trial itself And language has been added to subsection c to recognize explicitly that privileged matter may be excised from the witness s prior statement Committee Notes on Rules — 1998 Amendment The amendment to subdivision g mirrors similar amendments made in 1993 to this rule and to other Rules of Criminal Procedure which extended the application of Rule 26 2 to other proceedings both pretrial and post trial This amendment extends the requirement of producing a witness statement to preliminary examinations conducted under Rule 5 1 Subdivision g 1 has been amended to reflect changes to Rule 32 Changes Made to Rule 26 2 After Publication GAP Report The Committee made no changes to the published draft Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 26 2 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only except as noted below Current Rule 26 2 c states that if the court withholds a portion of a statement over the defendant s objection the attorney for the government must preserve the statement The Committee believed that the better rule would be for the court to simply seal the entire statement as a part of the record in the event that there is an appeal Also the terminology in Rule 26 2 c has been changed The rule now speaks in terms of a redacted statement instead of an excised statement No change in practice is intended Finally the list of proceedings in Rule 26 2 g has been placed in rule number order References in Text The Rules Governing Proceedings under 28 U S C § 2255 referred to in subd g 5 are set out under section 2255 of Title

opportunity to comment on the propriety of the order to state whether that party consents or objects and to suggest alternatives Added Apr 22 1993 eff Dec 1 1993 amended Apr 29 2002 eff Dec 1 2002 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1993 Rule 26 3 is a new rule designed to reduce the possibility of an erroneously ordered mistrial which could produce adverse and irretrievable consequences The Rule is not designed to change the substantive law governing mistrials Instead it is directed at providing both sides an opportunity to place on the record their views about the proposed mistrial order In particular the court must give each side an opportunity to state whether it objects or consents to the order Several cases have held that retrial of a defendant was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution because the trial court had abused its discretion in declaring a mistrial See United States v Dixon 913 F 2d 1305 8th Cir 1990 United States v Bates 917 F 2d 388 9th Cir 1990 In both cases the appellate courts concluded that the trial court had acted precipitately and had failed to solicit the parties views on the necessity of a mistrial and the feasibility of any alternative action The new Rule is designed to remedy that situation The Committee regards the Rule as a balanced and modest procedural device that could benefit both the prosecution and the defense While the Dixon and Bates decisions adversely affected the government s interest in prosecuting serious crimes the new Rule could also benefit defendants The Rule ensures that a defendant has the opportunity to dissuade a judge from declaring a mistrial in a case where granting one would not be an abuse of discretion but the defendant believes that the prospects for a favorable outcome before that particular court or jury are greater than they might be upon retrial Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 26 3 has been amended as part of the general restyling

close of all the evidence the court on the defendant s motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction The court may on its own consider whether the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction If the court denies a motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government s evidence the defendant may offer evidence without having reserved the right to do so b Reserving Decision The court may reserve decision on the motion proceed with the trial where the motion is made before the close of all the evidence submit the case to the jury and decide the motion either before the jury returns a verdict or after it returns a verdict of guilty or is discharged without having returned a verdict If the court reserves decision it must decide the motion on the basis of the evidence at the time the ruling was reserved c After Jury Verdict or Discharge 1 Time for a Motion A defendant may move for a judgment of acquittal or renew such a motion within 14 days after a guilty verdict or after the court discharges the jury whichever is later 2 Ruling on the Motion If the jury has returned a guilty verdict the court may set aside the verdict and enter an acquittal If the jury has failed to return a verdict the court may enter a judgment of acquittal 3 No Prior Motion Required A defendant is not required to move for a judgment of acquittal before the court submits the case to the jury as a prerequisite for making such a motion after jury discharge d Conditional Ruling on a Motion for a New Trial 1 Motion for a New Trial If the court enters a judgment of acquittal after a guilty verdict the court must also conditionally determine whether any motion for a new trial should be granted if the judgment of acquittal is later vacated or reversed The court must specify the reasons for that determination 2 Finality The court s order conditionally granting a motion for a new trial does not affect the finality of the judgment of acquittal 3 Appeal A Grant of a Motion for a New Trial If the court conditionally grants a motion for a new trial and an appellate court later reverses the judgment of acquittal the trial court must proceed with the new trial unless the appellate court orders otherwise B Denial of a Motion for a New Trial If the court conditionally denies a motion for a new trial an appellee may assert that the denial was erroneous If the appellate court later reverses the judgment of acquittal the trial court must proceed as the appellate court directs As amended

Advisory Committee on Rules — 1944 Note to Subdivision a 1 The purpose of changing the name of a motion for a directed verdict to a motion for judgment of acquittal is to make the nomenclature accord with the realities The change of nomenclature however does not modify the nature of the motion or enlarge the scope of matters that may be considered 2 The second sentence is patterned on New York Code of Criminal Procedure sec 410 3 The purpose of the third sentence is to remove the doubt existing in a few jurisdictions on the question whether the defendant is deemed to have rested his case if he moves for a directed verdict at the close of the prosecution s case The purpose of the rule is expressly to preserve the right of the defendant to offer evidence in his own behalf if such motion is denied This is a restatement of the prevailing practice and is also in accord with the practice prescribed for civil cases by Rule 50 a of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [ 28 U S C Appendix ] Note to Subdivision b This rule is in substance similar to Rule 50 b of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 28 U S C Appendix and permits the court to render judgment for the defendant

subdivision makes several changes in the former procedure A motion for judgment of acquittal may be made after discharge of the jury whether or not a motion was made before submission to the jury No legitimate interest of the government is intended to be prejudiced by permitting the court to direct an acquittal on a post verdict motion The constitutional requirement of a jury trial in criminal

34 References in the original rule to the motion for a new trial as an alternate to the motion for judgment of acquittal and to the power of the court to order a new trial have been eliminated Motions for new trial are adequately covered in Rule 33 Also the original wording is subject to the interpretation that a motion for judgment of acquittal gives the court power to order a new trial even though the defendant does not wish a new trial and has not asked for one Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1994 Amendment The amendment permits the reservation of a motion for a judgment of acquittal made at the close of the government s case in the the same manner as the rule now permits for motions made at the close of all of the evidence Although the rule as written did not permit the court to reserve such motions made at the end of the government s case trial courts on occasion have nonetheless reserved ruling See e g United States v Bruno 873 F 2d 555 2d Cir cert denied 110 S Ct 125 1989 United States v Reifsteck 841 F 2d 701 6th Cir 1988 While the amendment will not affect a large number of cases it should remove the dilemma in those close cases in which the court would feel pressured into making an immediate and possibly erroneous decision or violating the rule as presently written by reserving its ruling on the motion The amendment also permits the trial court to balance the defendant s interest in an immediate resolution of the motion against the interest of the government in proceeding to a verdict thereby preserving its right to appeal in the event a verdict of guilty is returned but is then set aside by the granting of a judgment of acquittal Under the double jeopardy clause the government may appeal the granting of a motion for judgment of acquittal only if there would be no necessity for another trial i e only where the jury has returned a verdict of guilty United States v Martin Linen Supply Co 430 U S 564 1977 Thus the government s right to appeal a Rule 29 motion is only preserved where the ruling is reserved until after the verdict In addressing the issue of preserving the government s right to appeal and at the same time recognizing double jeopardy concerns the Supreme Court observed We should point out that it is entirely possible for a trial court to reconcile the public interest in the Government s right to appeal from an erroneous conclusion of law with the defendant s interest in avoiding a second prosecution In United States v Wilson 420 U S 332 1975 the court permitted the case to go to the jury which returned a verdict of guilty but it subsequently dismissed the indictment for preindictment delay on the basis of evidence adduced at trial Most recently in United States v Ceccolini 435 U S 268 1978 we described similar action with approval The District Court had sensibly made its finding on the factual question of guilt or innocence and then ruled on the motion to suppress a reversal of these rulings would require no further proceeding in the District Court but merely a reinstatement of the finding of guilt Id at 271 United States v Scott 437 U S 82 100 n 13 1978 By analogy reserving a ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal strikes the same balance as that reflected by the Supreme Court in Scott Reserving a ruling on a motion made at the end of the government s case does pose problems however where the defense decides to present evidence and run the risk that such evidence will support the government s case To address that problem the amendment provides that the trial court is to consider only the evidence submitted at the time of the motion in making its ruling whenever made And in reviewing a trial court s ruling the appellate court would be similarly limited Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 29 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only except as noted below In Rule 29 a the first sentence abolishing directed verdicts has been deleted because it is unnecessary The rule continues to recognize that a judge may sua sponte enter a judgment of acquittal Rule 29 c 1 addresses the issue of the timing of a motion for judgment of acquittal The amended rule now includes language that the motion must be made within 7 days after a guilty verdict or after the judge discharges the jury whichever occurs later That change reflects the fact that in a capital case or in a case involving criminal forfeiture for example the jury may not be discharged until it has completed its sentencing duties The court may still set another time for the defendant to make or renew the motion if it does so within the 7 day period Committee Notes on Rules — 2005 Amendment Rule 29 c has been amended to remove the requirement that the court must act within seven days after a guilty verdict or after the court discharges the jury if it sets another time for filing a motion for a judgment of acquittal This amendment parallels similar changes to Rules 33 and 34 Further a conforming amendment has been made to Rule 45 b 2 Currently Rule 29 c requires the defendant to move for a judgment of acquittal within seven days of the guilty verdict or after the court discharges the jury whichever occurs later or some other time set by the court in an order issued within that same seven day period Similar provisions exist in Rules 33 and 34 Courts have held that the seven day rule is jurisdictional Thus if a defendant files a request for an extension of time to file a motion for a judgment of acquittal within the seven day period the court must rule on that motion or request within the same seven day period If for some reason the court does not rule on the request within the seven days it loses jurisdiction to act on the underlying substantive motion See e g United States v Smith 331 U S 469 473 – 474 1947 rejecting argument that trial court had power to grant new trial on its own motion after expiration of time in Rule 33 United States v Marquez 291 F 3d 23 27 – 28 D C Cir 2002 citing language of Rule 33 and holding that district court forfeited the power to act when it failed to fix a new time for filing a motion for a new trial within seven days of the verdict Assuming that the current rule was intended to promote finality there is nothing to prevent the court from granting a significant extension of time so long as it does so within the seven day period Thus the Committee believed that the rule should be amended to be consistent with all of the other timing requirements in the rules which do not force the court to act on a motion to extend the time for filing within a particular period of time or lose jurisdiction to do so Accordingly the amendment deletes the language regarding the court s acting within seven days to set the time for filing Read in conjunction with the conforming amendment to Rule 45 b the defendant is still required to file a timely motion for a judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 within the seven day period specified The defendant may under Rule 45 seek an extension of time to file the underlying motion as long as the defendant does so within the seven day period But the court itself is not required to act on that motion within any particular time Further under Rule 45 b 1 B if for some reason the defendant fails to file the underlying motion within the specified time the court may nonetheless consider that untimely motion if the court determines that the failure to file it on time was the result of excusable neglect Changes Made After Publication and Comment The Committee made no substantive changes to Rule 29 following publication Committee Notes on Rules — 2009 Amendment Former Rules 29 33 and 34 adopted 7 day periods for their respective motions This period has been expanded to 14 days Experience has proved that in many cases it is not possible to prepare a satisfactory motion in 7 days even under the former rule that excluded intermediate Saturdays Sundays and legal holidays This led to frequent requests for continuances and the filing of bare bones motions that required later supplementation The 14 day period — including intermediate Saturdays Sundays and legal holidays as provided by Rule 45 a — sets a more realistic time for the filing of these motions Amendment by Public Law 1986 — Subd d Pub L 99 – 646 added subd d Effective Date of 1986 Amendment Pub L 99 – 646 § 54 b Nov 10 1986 100 Stat 3607 provided that The amendments made by this section [ amending this rule ] shall take effect 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [ Nov 10

29 2002 eff Dec 1 2002 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1974 This rule is designed to control the order of closing argument It reflects the Advisory Committee s view that it is desirable to have a uniform federal practice The rule is drafted in the view that fair and effective administration of justice is best served if the defendant knows the arguments actually made by the prosecution in behalf of conviction before the defendant is faced with the decision whether to reply and what to reply Notes of Committee on the Judiciary House Report No 94 – 247 1975 Amendment A Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court Rule 29 1 is a new rule that was added to regulate closing arguments It prescribes that the government shall make its closing argument and then the defendant shall make his After the defendant has argued the government is entitled to reply in rebuttal B Committee Action The Committee endorses and adopts this proposed rule in its entirety The Committee believes that as the Advisory Committee Note has stated fair and effective administration of justice is best served if the defendant knows the arguments actually made by the prosecution in behalf of conviction before the defendant is faced with the decision whether to reply and what to reply Rule 29 1 does not specifically address itself to what happens if the prosecution waives its initial closing argument The Committee is of the view that the prosecutor when he waives his initial closing argument also waives his rebuttal [ See the remarks of Senior United States Circuit Judge J Edward Lumbard in Hearings II at 207 ] Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 29 1 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only Effective Date This rule effective Dec 1 1975 see section 2 of Pub L 94 – 64 set out as a note under rule 4 of these rules Rule 30 Jury Instructions a In General Any party may request in writing that the court instruct the jury on the law as specified in the request The request must be made at the close of the evidence or at any earlier time that the court reasonably sets When the request is made the requesting party must furnish a copy to every other party b Ruling on a Request The court must inform the parties before closing arguments how it intends to rule on the requested instructions c Time for Giving Instructions The court may instruct the jury before or after the arguments are completed or at both times d Objections to Instructions A party who objects to any portion of the instructions or to a failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate An opportunity must be given to object out of the jury s hearing and on request out of the jury s presence Failure to object in accordance with this rule precludes appellate review except as permitted under Rule 52 b As amended Feb 28 1966 eff July 1 1966 Mar 9 1987 eff Aug 1 1987 Apr 25 1988 eff Aug 1 1988 Apr 29 2002 eff Dec 1 2002 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1944 This rule corresponds to Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [ 28 U S C Appendix ] the second sentence alone being new It seemed appropriate that on a point such as instructions to juries there should be no difference in procedure between civil and criminal cases Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1966 Amendment The amendment requires the court on request of any party to require the jury to withdraw in order to permit full argument of objections to instructions Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment In its current form Rule 30 requires that the court instruct the jury after the arguments of counsel In some districts usually where the state practice is otherwise the parties prefer to stipulate to instruction before closing arguments The purpose of the amendment is to give the court discretion to instruct the jury before or after closing arguments or at both times The amendment will permit courts to continue instructing the jury after arguments as Rule 30 had previously required It will also permit courts to instruct before arguments in order to give the parties an opportunity to argue to the jury in light of the exact language used by the court See generally Raymond Merits and Demerits of the Missouri System in Instructing Juries 5 St Louis U L J 317 1959 Finally the amendment plainly indicates that the court may instruct both before and after arguments which assures that the court retains power to remedy omissions in pre argument instructions or to add instructions necessitated by the arguments Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1988 Amendment The amendment is technical No substantive change is intended Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The language of Rule 30 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules These changes are intended to be stylistic only except as noted below Rule 30 a reflects a change in the timing of requests for instructions As currently written the trial court may not direct the parties to file such requests before trial without violating Rules 30 and 57 While the amendment falls short of requiring all requests to be made before trial in all cases the amendment permits a court to do so in a particular case or as a matter of local practice under local rules promulgated under Rule 57 The rule does not preclude the practice of permitting the parties to supplement their requested instructions during the trial Rule 30 d clarifies what if anything counsel must do to preserve a claim of error regarding an instruction or failure to instruct The rule retains the requirement of a contemporaneous and specific objection before the jury retires to deliberate As the Supreme Court recognized in Jones v United States 527 U S 373 1999 read literally current Rule 30 could be construed to bar any appellate review absent a timely objection when in fact a court may conduct a limited review under a plain error standard The amendment does not address the issue of whether objections to the instructions must be renewed after the instructions are given in order to preserve a claim of error No change in practice is intended by the amendment Rule 31 Jury Verdict a Return The jury must return its verdict to a judge in open court The verdict must be unanimous b Partial Verdicts Mistrial and Retrial 1 Multiple Defendants If there are multiple defendants the jury may return a verdict at any time during its deliberations as to any defendant about whom it has agreed 2 Multiple Counts If the jury cannot agree on all counts as to any defendant the jury may return a verdict on those counts on which it has agreed 3 Mistrial and Retrial If the jury cannot agree on a verdict on one or more counts the court may declare a mistrial on those counts The government may retry any defendant on any count on which the jury could not agree c A defendant may be found guilty of any of the following 1 an offense necessarily included in the offense charged 2 an attempt to commit the offense charged or 3 an attempt to commit an offense necessarily included in the offense charged if the attempt is an offense in its own right d Jury Poll After a verdict is returned but before the jury is discharged the court must on a party s request or may on its own poll the jurors individually If the poll reveals a lack of unanimity the court may direct the jury to deliberate further or may declare a mistrial and discharge the jury As amended Apr 24 1972 eff Oct 1 1972 Apr 24 1998 eff Dec 1 1998 Apr 17 2000 eff Dec 1 2000 Apr 29 2002 eff Dec 1 2002 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1944 Note to Subdivision a This rule is a restatement of existing law and practice It does not embody any regulation of sealed verdicts it being contemplated that this matter would be governed by local practice in the various district courts The rule does not affect the existing statutes relating to qualified verdicts in cases in which capital punishment may be

Committee on Rules — 1972 Amendment Subdivision e is new It is intended to provide procedural implementation of the recently enacted criminal forfeiture provision of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 Title IX § 1963 and the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 Title II § 408 a 2 The assumption of the draft is that the amount of the interest or property subject to criminal forfeiture is an element of the offense to be alleged and proved See Advisory Committee Note to rule 7 c 2 Although special verdict provisions are rare in criminal cases they are not unknown See United States v Spock 416 F 2d 165 1st Cir 1969 especially footnote 41 where authorities are listed Committee Notes on Rules — 1998 Amendment The right of a party to have the jury polled is an undoubted right Humphries v District of Columbia 174 U S 190 194 1899 Its purpose is to determine with certainty that each of the jurors approves of the verdict as returned that no one has been coerced or induced to sign a verdict to which he does not fully assent Id Currently Rule 31 d is silent on the precise method of polling the jury Thus a court in its discretion may conduct the poll collectively or individually As one court has noted although the prevailing view is that the method used is a matter within the discretion of the trial court United States v Miller 59 F 3d 417 420 3d Cir 1995 citing cases the preference nonetheless of the appellate and trial courts seems to favor individual polling Id citing cases That is the position taken in the American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice § 15 – 4 5 Those sources favoring individual polling observe that conducting a poll of the jurors collectively saves little time and does not always adequately insure that an individual juror who has been forced to join the majority during deliberations will voice dissent from a collective response On the other hand an advantage to individual polling is the likelihood that it will discourage post trial efforts to challenge the verdict on allegations of coercion on the part of some of the jurors Miller Id at 420 citing Audette v Isaksen Fishing Corp 789 F 2d 956 961 n 6 1st Cir 1986 The Committee is persuaded by the authorities and practice that there are advantages of conducting an individual poll of the jurors Thus the rule requires that the jurors be polled individually when a polling is requested or when polling is directed sua sponte by the court The amendment however leaves to the court the discretion as to whether to conduct a separate poll for each defendant each count of the indictment or complaint or on other issues Changes Made to Rule 31 After Publication GAP Report The Committee changed the rule to require that any polling of the jury must be done before the jury is discharged and it incorporated suggested style changes submitted by the Style Subcommittee Committee Notes on Rules — 2000 Amendment The rule is amended to reflect the creation of new Rule 32 2 which now governs criminal forfeiture procedures GAP Report — Rule 31 The Committee made no changes to the published draft amendment to Rule 31 Committee Notes on Rules —
