strike against his secret compound in Abbottabad Pakistan 2 Osama bin Laden was the leader of the al Qaeda terrorist organization the most significant terrorism threat to the United States and the international community 3 Osama bin Laden was the architect of terrorist attacks which killed nearly 3 000 civilians on September 11 2001 the most deadly terrorist attack against our Nation in which al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airplanes and crashed them into the World Trade Center in New York City the Pentagon in Washington D C and due to heroic efforts by civilian passengers to disrupt the terrorists near Shanksville Pennsylvania 4 Osama bin Laden planned or supported numerous other deadly terrorist attacks against the United States and its allies including the 1998 bombings of United

Madrid Spain and the 2005 bombings of the mass transit system in London England 5 Following the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks the United States under President George W Bush led an international coalition into Afghanistan to dismantle al Qaeda deny them a safe haven in Afghanistan and ungoverned areas along the Pakistani border and bring Osama bin Laden to justice 6 President Barack Obama in

community prompted the Director of National Intelligence General James Clapper to state Never have I seen a more remarkable example of focused integration seamless collaboration and sheer professional magnificence as was demonstrated by the Intelligence Community in the ultimate demise of Osama bin Laden 10 While the death of Osama bin Laden represents a significant blow to the al Qaeda

source Intelligence Pub L 109 – 163 div A title IX § 931 Jan 6 2006 119 Stat 3411 provided that a Findings — Congress makes the following findings 1 Open source intelligence OSINT is intelligence that is produced from publicly available information and is collected exploited and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement 2 With the Information Revolution the amount significance and accessibility of open source information has expanded significantly but the intelligence community has not expanded its exploitation efforts and systems to produce open source intelligence 3 The production of open source intelligence is a valuable intelligence discipline that must be integrated into intelligence tasking collection processing exploitation and dissemination to ensure that United States policymakers are fully and completely informed 4 The dissemination and use of validated open source intelligence inherently enables information sharing since open source intelligence is produced without the use of sensitive sources and methods Open source intelligence products can be shared with the American public and foreign allies because of the unclassified nature of open source intelligence 5 The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States popularly referred to as the 9 11 Commission in its final report released on July 22 2004 identified shortfalls in the ability of the United States to use all source intelligence a large component of which is open source intelligence 6 In the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 Public Law 108 – 458 [ see Tables for classification ] Congress calls for coordination of the collection analysis
