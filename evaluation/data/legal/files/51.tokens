Findings Pub L 97 – 414 § 1 b Jan 4 1983 96 Stat 2049 provided that The Congress finds that — 1 there are many diseases and conditions such as Huntington s disease myoclonus ALS Lou Gehrig s disease Tourette syndrome and muscular dystrophy which affect such small numbers of individuals residing in the United States that the diseases and conditions are considered rare in the United States 2 adequate drugs for many of such diseases and conditions have not been developed 3 drugs for these diseases and conditions are commonly referred to as orphan drugs 4 because so few individuals are affected by any one rare disease or condition a pharmaceutical company which develops an orphan drug may reasonably expect the drug to generate relatively small sales in comparison to the cost of developing the drug and consequently to incur a financial loss 5 there is reason to believe that some promising orphan drugs will not be developed unless changes are made in the applicable Federal laws to reduce the costs of developing such drugs and to provide financial incentives to develop such drugs and 6 it is in the public interest to provide such changes and incentives for the development of orphan drugs § 360bb Designation of drugs for rare diseases or conditions a Request by sponsor preconditions rare disease or condition defined 1 The manufacturer or the sponsor of a

A request for a designation of a drug under this subsection shall contain the consent of the applicant to notice being given by the Secretary under subsection b respecting the designation of the drug 2 For purposes of paragraph 1 the term rare disease or condition means any disease or condition which A affects less than 200 000 persons in the United States or B affects more than 200 000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such drug Determinations under the preceding sentence with respect to any drug shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances as of the date the request for designation of the drug under this subsection is made b Notification of discontinuance of drug or application as condition A designation of a drug under subsection a shall be subject to the condition that — 1 if an application was approved for the drug under section 355 b of this title or a license was issued for the drug under section 262 of title 42 the manufacturer of the drug will notify the

1985 Amendment Amendment by Pub L 99 – 91 effective Oct 1 1985 see section 8 a of Pub L 99 – 91 set out as a note under section 360aa of this title Findings and Purposes Pub L 107 – 281 § 2 Nov 6 2002 116 Stat 1992 provided that a Findings — Congress makes the following findings 1 Rare diseases and disorders are those which affect small patient populations typically populations smaller than 200 000 individuals in the United States Such diseases and conditions include Huntington s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Lou Gehrig s disease Tourette syndrome Crohn s disease cystic fibrosis cystinosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy 2 For many years the 25 000 000 Americans suffering from the over 6 000 rare diseases and disorders were denied access to effective medicines because prescription drug manufacturers could rarely make a profit from marketing drugs for such small groups of patients The prescription drug industry did not adequately fund research into such treatments Despite the urgent health need for these medicines they came to be known as orphan drugs because no companies would commercialize them 3 During the 1970s an organization called the National Organization for Rare Disorders NORD was founded to provide services and to lobby on behalf of patients with rare diseases and disorders NORD was instrumental in pressing Congress for legislation to encourage the development of orphan drugs 4 The Orphan Drug Act [ see Short Title of 1983 Amendments note set out under section 301 of this title ] created financial incentives for the research and production of such orphan drugs New Federal programs at the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration encouraged clinical research and commercial product development for products that target rare diseases An Orphan Products Board was established to promote the development of drugs and devices for rare diseases or disorders 5 Before 1983 some 38 orphan drugs had been developed Since the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act [ Jan 4 1983 ] more than 220 new orphan drugs have been approved and marketed in the United States and more than 800 additional drugs are in the research pipeline 6 Despite the tremendous success of the Orphan Drug Act rare diseases and disorders deserve greater emphasis in the national biomedical research enterprise 7 The Food and Drug Administration supports small clinical trials through Orphan Products Research Grants Such grants embody successful partnerships of government and industry and have led to the development of at least 23 drugs and four medical devices for rare diseases and disorders Yet the appropriations in fiscal year 2001 for such grants were less than in fiscal year 1995 b Purposes — The purpose of this Act [ see Short Title of 2002 Amendments note set out under section 301 of this title ] is to increase the national investment in the development of diagnostics and treatments for patients with rare diseases and disorders § 360ff Priority review to encourage treatments for rare pediatric diseases a Definitions In this section 1 Priority review The term priority review with respect to a human drug application as defined in section 379g 1 of this title means review and action by the Secretary on such application not later than 6 months after receipt by the Secretary of such application as

§ 102 a Aug 2 2004 118 Stat 891 provided that Congress makes the following findings 1 There is a severe shortage of approved new animal drugs for use in minor species 2 There is a severe shortage of approved new animal drugs for treating animal diseases and conditions that occur infrequently or in limited geographic areas 3 Because of the small market shares low profit margins involved and capital investment required it is generally not economically feasible for new animal drug applicants to pursue approvals for these species diseases and conditions 4 Because the populations for which such new animal drugs are intended may be small and conditions of animal management may vary widely it is often difficult to design and conduct studies to establish drug safety and effectiveness under traditional new animal drug approval processes 5 It is in the public interest and in the interest of animal welfare to provide for special procedures to allow the lawful use and marketing of certain new animal drugs for minor species and minor uses that take into account these special circumstances and that ensure that such drugs do not endanger animal or public health 6 Exclusive marketing rights for clinical testing expenses have helped encourage the development of orphan drugs for human use and comparable incentives should encourage the development of new animal drugs for minor species and minor uses Regulations Pub L 108 – 282 title I § 102 b 6 Aug 2 2004 118 Stat 905 provided that On the date of enactment of this Act [ Aug 2 2004 ] the Secretary of Health and Human
