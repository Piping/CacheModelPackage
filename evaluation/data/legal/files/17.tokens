matter so designed and so presented as to exploit sexual sensationalism for commercial gain 2 that such matter is profoundly shocking and offensive to many persons who receive it unsolicited through the mails 3 that such use of the mails constitutes a serious threat to the dignity and sanctity of the American home and subjects many persons to an unconscionable and unwarranted intrusion upon their fundamental personal right to privacy 4 that such use of the mail reduces the ability of responsible parents to protect their minor children from exposure to material which they as parents believe to be harmful to the normal and healthy ethical mental and social development of their children and 5 that the traffic in such offensive advertisements is so large that individual citizens will be helpless to protect their privacy or their families without stronger and more effective Federal controls over the mailing of such matter b [ Congressional Determination of Public Policy ] On the basis

to examine such letters or mail and to obtain delivery of mail which is clearly not connected with activity alleged to be in violation of section 3010 of this title b The statement that remittances

a of this section a district court of the United States upon application therefor by the Attorney General and upon a showing of probable cause to believe the statute is being violated may enter a
