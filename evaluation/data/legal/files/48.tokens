per centum of the cost of constructing reconstructing or reconditioning the vessel excluding the cost of national defense features If the Secretary finds that the construction differential exceeds in any case the foregoing percentage of such cost the Secretary may negotiate with any bidder whether or not such person is the lowest bidder and may contract with such bidder notwithstanding the first sentence of section 505 for the construction reconstruction or reconditioning of the vessel involved in a domestic shipyard at a cost which will reduce the construction differential to such percentage or less In the event that the Secretary has reason to believe that the bidding in any instance is collusive he shall report all of the evidence on which he acted 1 to the Attorney General of the United States and 2 to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives if the Congress shall be in session or if the Congress shall not be in session then to the

provided for the payments on account of the construction cost in the contract between the shipbuilder and the Secretary of Transportation The purchaser shall pay not less frequently than annually interest on those portions of the Secretary of Transportation s payments as made to the shipbuilder which are chargeable to the purchaser s portion of the price of the vessel after deduction of the purchaser s cash payments at a rate not less than i a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans adjusted to the nearest one eighth of 1 per centum plus ii an allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation to cover administrative costs The balance of such purchase price shall be paid by the purchaser within twenty five years after delivery of the vessel and in not to exceed twenty five equal annual installments the first of which shall be payable one year after the delivery of the vessel by the Secretary of Transportation to the purchaser Interest at the

the bids received from privately owned shipyards of the United States are collusive excessive or unreasonable and if a citizen of the United States agrees to purchase said vessel as provided in this section then to provide employment for citizens of the United States the Secretary of Transportation may have such vessel constructed outfitted or equipped at not in excess of the actual cost thereof

existing or impending inadequacy in such mobilization base as to the capabilities and capacities of a shipyard or shipyards at a strategic point and after taking into consideration the benefits accruing from standardized construction the conditions of unemployment and the needs and reasonable requirements of all shipyards may allocate such construction reconstruction reconditioning or remodeling to such yard or yards in such manner as he may determine to be fair just and reasonable to all sections of the country subject to the provisions of this subsection In the allocation of

price in excess of the lowest responsible bid which otherwise would be accepted such excess shall be paid by the Secretary of Transportation as a part of the cost of national defense and shall not be considered as a part of the construction differential subsidy In the event that a contract is made providing for a price lower than the lowest responsible bid which otherwise would be accepted the construction differential subsidy shall be computed on the contract price in lieu of such bid If as a result of allocation under this subsection the purchaser incurs expenses for inspection and supervision of the vessel during construction and for the delivery voyage of the vessel in excess of the estimated expenses for the same services that he would have incurred if the vessel had been constructed by the lowest responsible bidder the Secretary of Transportation with respect to construction under title V except section 509 shall reimburse the purchaser for such excess less one half of any gross income the purchaser receives that is allocable to the delivery voyage minus one half of the extra expenses incurred to produce such gross income and such reimbursement shall not be considered part of the construction differential subsidy Provided That no interest shall be paid on any refund authorized under this Act If the vessel is constructed under section 509 the Secretary of Transportation shall reduce the price of the vessel by such excess less one half of any gross income minus one half of the extra expenses incurred to produce such gross income the purchaser receives that is allocable to the delivery voyage In the case of a vessel that is not to receive operating differential subsidy the delivery voyage shall be deemed terminated at the port where the vessel begins loading In the case of a vessel that is to receive operating differential subsidy the delivery voyage shall be deemed terminated when the vessel begins loading at a United States port in an essential service In either case however the vessel owner shall not be compensated for excess vessel delivery costs in an amount greater than the expenses that would have been incurred in delivering the vessel from the shipyard at which it was built to the shipyard of the lowest responsible bidder If as a result of such allocation the expenses the purchaser incurs with respect to such services are less than the expenses he would have incurred for such services if the vessel had been constructed by the lowest responsible bidder the purchaser shall pay to the Secretary of Transportation an amount equal to such reduction and if the vessel was built with the aid of construction differential subsidy such payment shall not be considered a reduction of the construction differential subsidy g
