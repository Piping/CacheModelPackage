feature in many electronic systems a large number of activities in the public and private sectors could be at risk beginning in the year 2000 Some computer systems and other electronic devices will misinterpret the year 00 as 1900 rather than 2000 Unless appropriate action is taken this flaw known as the Y2K problem can cause systems that support those functions to compute erroneously or simply not run Minimizing the Y2K problem will require a major technological and managerial effort and it is critical that the United States Government do its part in addressing this challenge Accordingly by
