section for the subsequent injury or for one hundred and four weeks whichever is the greater except that in the case of an injury falling within the provisions of subsection c 13 of this section the employer shall provide compensation for the lesser of such periods In all other cases of total permanent disability or of death found not to be due solely to that injury of an employee having an existing permanent partial disability the employer shall provide in addition to compensation under subsections b and e of this section compensation payments or death benefits for one hundred and four weeks only If following an injury falling within the provisions of subsection c 1 – 20 of this section the employee has a permanent partial disability and the disability is found not to be due solely to that injury and such disability is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone the employer shall provide compensation for the applicable period of weeks provided for in that section for the subsequent injury or for one hundred and four weeks whichever is the greater except that in the case of an injury falling within the provisions of subsection c 13 of this section the employer shall provide compensation for the lesser of such periods In all other cases in which the employee has a permanent partial disability found not to be due solely to that injury and such disability is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone the employer shall provide in

apportionment of liability to the special fund established under section 944 of this title for the payment of compensation benefits and a statement of the grounds therefore shall be presented to the

liability for the payment of any benefits in connection with such claim unless the employer could not have reasonably anticipated the liability of the special fund prior to the issuance of a compensation order g Maintenance for employees undergoing vocational rehabilitation An employee who as a result of injury is or may be expected to be totally or partially incapacitated for a

if such actual earnings fairly and reasonably represent his wage earning capacity Provided however That if the employee has no actual earnings or his actual earnings do not fairly and reasonably represent his wage earning capacity the deputy commissioner may in the interest of justice fix such wage earning capacity as shall be reasonable having due regard to the nature of his injury the degree of physical impairment his usual employment and any other factors or circumstances in the case which may affect his capacity to earn wages in his disabled condition including the effect of disability as it may naturally extend into the future i 1 Whenever the parties to any claim for compensation under this chapter including survivors benefits agree to a settlement the deputy

upon at any stage of the proceeding including after entry of a final compensation order 4 The special fund shall not be liable for reimbursement of any sums paid or payable to an employee or any beneficiary under such settlement or otherwise voluntarily paid prior to such settlement by the employer or carrier or both j 1 The employer may inform a disabled employee of his obligation to report to the employer not less than semiannually any earnings from employment or self employment on such forms as the Secretary shall specify in regulations 2 An employee who — A fails to report the employee s earnings under paragraph 1 when requested or B knowingly and willfully omits or understates any part of such earnings and who is determined by the deputy commissioner to have violated clause A or B of this paragraph forfeits his right to compensation with respect to any period during which the employee was required to file such report 3 Compensation forfeited under this subsection

weekly wage of the injured employee at the time of the injury shall be taken as the basis upon which to compute compensation and shall be determined as follows a If the injured employee shall have worked in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury whether for the same or another employer during substantially the whole of the year immediately preceding his injury his average annual earnings shall consist of three hundred times the average daily wage or salary for a six day worker and two hundred and sixty times the average daily wage or salary for a five day worker which he shall have earned in such employment during the days when so employed b If the injured employee shall not have worked in such employment during substantially the whole of such year his

which an employee of the same class working substantially the whole of such immediately preceding year in the same or in similar employment in the same or a neighboring place shall have earned in such employment during the days when so employed c If either of the foregoing methods of arriving at the average annual earnings of the injured employee cannot reasonably and fairly be applied such average annual earnings shall be such sum as having regard to the previous earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury and of other employees of the same or most similar class working in the same or most similar employment in the same or neighboring locality or other employment of such employee including the reasonable value of the services of the employee if engaged in self employment shall reasonably represent the annual earning capacity of the injured employee d 1 The average weekly wages of an employee shall be one fifty second part of his

subsection i of this section occurs — A within the first year after the employee has retired the average weekly wages shall be one fifty second part of his average annual earnings during the 52 week period preceding retirement or B more than one year after the employee has retired the average weekly wage shall be deemed to be the national average weekly wage as determined by the Secretary pursuant to section 906 b of this title applicable at the time of the injury e If it be established that the injured employee was a minor when injured and that under normal conditions his wages should be expected to increase during the period of disability the fact may be considered in arriving at his average weekly wages f Effective October 1 of each year the compensation or death benefits payable for permanent total disability or death arising out of injuries subject to this chapter shall be increased by the lesser of — 1 a percentage equal to the percentage if any by which the applicable national weekly wage for the period beginning on such October 1 as determined under section 906 b of this title exceeds the applicable national average weekly wage as so determined for the period beginning with the preceding October 1 or 2 5 per centum g The weekly compensation after adjustment under subsection f of this section shall be fixed at the nearest dollar No adjustment of less than $

the Secretary by designating as the employee s average weekly wage the applicable national average weekly wage determined under section 906 b of this title and A computing the compensation to which such employee or survivor would be entitled if the disabling injury or death had occurred on the day following October 27 1972 and B subtracting therefrom the compensation to which such employee or survivor was entitled on October 27 1972 except that no such employee or survivor shall receive total compensation amounting to less than that to which he was entitled on October 27 1972 Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence where such an employee or his survivor was awarded compensation as the result of death or permanent total disability at less than the maximum rate that was provided in this chapter at the time of the injury which resulted in the death or disability then his average weekly wage shall be determined by increasing his average weekly wage at the time of such injury by the percentage which the applicable national average weekly wage has increased between the year in which the injury occurred and the first day of the first month following October 27 1972 Where such injury occurred prior to 1947 the Secretary shall determine on the basis of such economic data as he deems relevant the amount by which the employee s average weekly wage shall be increased
