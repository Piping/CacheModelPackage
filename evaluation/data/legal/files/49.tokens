project in the manner determined by the Secretary 2 That the part of the construction costs allocated by the Secretary to irrigation shall be included in a general repayment obligation of the organization and that the organization may vary its distribution of construction charges in a manner that takes into account the productivity of the various classes of lands and the benefits accruing to the lands by reason of the construction Provided That no distribution of construction charges over the lands included in the organization shall in any manner be deemed to relieve the organization or any party or any land therein of the organization s general obligation to the United States 3 That the general repayment obligation of the organization shall be spread in annual installments of the

project contract unit be divided into two or more irrigation blocks for any such block or as near to said period of not more than forty years as is consistent with the adoption and operation of a variable payment formula which being based on full repayment within such period under average conditions permits variance in the required annual payments in the light of economic factors pertinent to the ability of the organization to pay 4 That the first annual installment for any project contract unit or for any irrigation block as the case may be shall accrue on the date fixed by the Secretary in the year after the last year of the development period or if there be not development period in the calendar year after the Secretary announces that the construction contemplated in the repayment

maintenance cost and an appropriate share of such fixed charges as the Secretary deems proper due consideration being given to that part of the cost of construction of works connected with water supply and allocated to irrigation and shall require payment of said rates each year in advance of delivery of water for said year In the event such contracts are made for furnishing water for irrigation purposes the costs of any irrigation water distribution works constructed by the United States in connection with the new project new division of a project or supplemental works on a project shall be covered by a repayment contract entered into pursuant to said subsection d f Public participation No less than sixty days before entering into or amending any repayment contract or
