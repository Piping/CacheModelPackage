Ballistic Missile Defense Act of 1995 SEC 232 FINDINGS Congress makes the following findings 1 The emerging threat that is posed to the national security interests of the United States by the proliferation of ballistic missiles is significant and growing both in terms of numbers of missiles and in terms of the technical capabilities of those missiles 2 The deployment of ballistic missile defenses is a necessary but not sufficient element of a broader strategy to discourage both the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the proliferation of the means of their delivery and to defend against the consequences of such proliferation 3 The deployment of effective Theater Missile Defense systems can deter potential adversaries of the United States from escalating a conflict by threatening or attacking United States forces or the forces or territory of coalition partners or allies of the United States with ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction to offset the operational and technical advantages of the United States and its coalition partners and allies 4 United States intelligence officials have provided intelligence estimates to congressional committees that A the trend in missile proliferation is toward longer range and more sophisticated ballistic missiles B North Korea may deploy an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching Alaska or beyond within five years and C although a new indigenously developed ballistic missile threat to the continental United States is not foreseen within the next ten years determined countries can acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in the near future and with little warning by means other than indigenous development 5 The development and deployment by the United States and its allies of effective defenses against ballistic missiles of all ranges will reduce the incentives for countries to acquire such missiles or to augment existing missile capabilities 6 The concept of mutual assured destruction based upon an offense only form of deterrence which is the major philosophical rationale underlying the ABM Treaty is now questionable as a basis for stability in a multipolar world in which the United States and the states of the former Soviet Union are seeking to normalize relations and eliminate Cold War attitudes and arrangements 7 The development and deployment of a National Missile Defense system against the threat of limited ballistic missile attacks — A would strengthen deterrence at the levels of forces agreed to by the United States and Russia under the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks Treaty START – I and B would further strengthen deterrence if reductions below the levels permitted under START – I should be agreed to and implemented in the future 8 The distinction made during the Cold War based upon the technology of the time between strategic ballistic missiles and nonstrategic ballistic missiles which resulted in the distinction made in the ABM Treaty between strategic defense and nonstrategic defense has become obsolete because of technological advancement including the development by North Korea of long range Taepo Dong I and Taepo Dong II missiles and therefore that distinction in the ABM Treaty should be reviewed SEC 233 BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY It is the policy of the United States — 1 to deploy affordable and operationally effective theater missile defenses to protect forward deployed and expeditionary elements of the Armed Forces of the United States and to complement the missile defense capabilities of forces of coalition partners and of allies of the United States and 2 to seek a cooperative negotiated transition to a regime that does not feature an offense only form of deterrence as the basis for strategic stability SEC 234 THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE a Establishment of Core Program — To implement the policy established in paragraph 1 of section 233 the Secretary of Defense shall restructure the core theater missile defense program to consist of the following systems 1 The Patriot PAC – 3 system 2 The Navy Area Defense system 3 The Theater High Altitude Area Defense THAAD system 4 The Navy Theater Wide system b Use of Streamlined Acquisition Procedures — The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe and use streamlined acquisition policies and procedures to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of developing and deploying the theater missile defense systems specified in subsection a c Interoperability and Support of Core Systems — To maximize effectiveness and flexibility of the systems comprising the core theater missile defense program the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that those systems are integrated and complementary and are fully capable of exploiting external sensor and battle management support from systems such as — A the Cooperative Engagement Capability CEC system of the Navy B airborne sensors and C space based sensors including in particular the Space and Missile Tracking System d Follow on Systems — 1 The Secretary of Defense shall prepare an affordable development plan for theater missile defense systems to be developed as follow on systems to the core systems specified in subsection a The Secretary shall make the selection of a system for inclusion in the plan based on the capability of the system to satisfy military requirements not met by the systems in the core program and on the capability of the system to use prior investments in technologies infrastructure and battle management capabilities that are incorporated in or associated with the systems in the core program 2 The Secretary may not proceed with the development of a follow on theater missile defense system beyond the Demonstration Validation stage of development unless the Secretary designates that system as a part of the core program under this section and submits to the congressional defense committees [ Committees on Armed Services and on Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives ] notice of that designation The Secretary shall include with any such notification a report describing — A the requirements for the system and the specific threats that such system is designed to counter B how the system will relate to support and build upon existing core systems C the planned acquisition strategy for the system and D a preliminary estimate of total program cost for that system and the effect of development and acquisition of such system on Department of Defense budget projections e Program Accountability Report — 1 As part of the annual report of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization [ now Missile Defense Agency ] required by section 224 of Public Law 101 – 189 10 U S C 2431 note the Secretary of Defense shall describe the technical milestones the schedule and the cost of each phase of development and acquisition together with total estimated program costs for each core and follow on theater missile defense program 2 As part of such report the Secretary shall describe with respect to each program covered in the report any variance in the technical milestones program schedule milestones and costs for the program compared with the information relating to that program in the report submitted in the previous year and in the report submitted in the first year in which that program was covered SEC 235 PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT CONCERNING THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS a Findings — 1 Congress hereby reaffirms — A the finding in [ former ] section 234 a 7 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 Public Law 103 – 160 107 Stat 1595 10 U S C 2431 note that the ABM Treaty was not intended to and does not apply to or limit research development testing or deployment of missile defense systems system upgrades or system components that are designed to counter modern theater ballistic missiles regardless of the capabilities of such missiles unless those systems system upgrades or system components are tested against or have demonstrated capabilities to counter modern strategic ballistic missiles and B the statement in section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 Public Law 103 – 337 108 Stat 2700 that the United States shall not be bound by any international agreement entered into by the President that would substantively modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is entered into pursuant to the treaty making power of the President under the Constitution 2 Congress also finds that the demarcation standard described in subsection b 1 for compliance of a missile defense system system upgrade or system component with the ABM Treaty is based upon current technology b Sense of Congress Concerning Compliance Policy — It is the sense of Congress that — 1 unless a missile defense system system upgrade or system component including one that exploits data from space based or other external sensors is flight tested in an ABM qualifying flight test as defined in subsection e that system system upgrade or system component has not for purposes of the ABM Treaty been tested in an ABM mode nor been given capabilities to counter strategic ballistic missiles and therefore is not subject to any application limitation or obligation under the ABM Treaty and 2 any international agreement that would limit the research development testing or deployment of missile defense systems system upgrades or system components that are designed to counter modern theater ballistic missiles in a manner that would be more restrictive than the compliance criteria specified in paragraph 1 should be entered into only pursuant to the treaty making powers of the President under the Constitution c Prohibition on Funding — Funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1996 may not be obligated or expended to implement an agreement or any understanding with respect to interpretation of the ABM Treaty between the United States and any of the independent states of the former Soviet Union entered into after January 1 1995 that — 1 would establish a demarcation between theater missile defense systems and anti ballistic missile systems for purposes of the ABM Treaty or 2 would restrict the performance operation or deployment of United States theater missile defense systems d Exceptions — Subsection c does not apply — 1 to the extent provided by law in an Act enacted after this Act [ Pub L 104 – 106 enacted Feb 10 1996 ] 2 to expenditures to implement that portion of any such agreement or understanding that implements the policy set forth in subsection b 1 or 3 to expenditures to implement any such agreement or understanding that is approved as a treaty or by law e ABM Qualifying Flight Test Defined — For purposes of this section an ABM qualifying flight test is a flight test against a ballistic missile which in that flight test exceeds 1 a range of 3 500 kilometers or 2 a velocity of 5 kilometers per second SEC 236 BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION WITH ALLIES It is in the interest of the United States to develop its own missile defense capabilities in a manner that will permit the United States to complement the missile defense capabilities developed and deployed by its allies and possible coalition partners Therefore the Congress urges the President — 1 to pursue high level discussions with allies of the United States and selected other states on the means and methods by which the parties on a bilateral basis can cooperate in the development deployment and operation of ballistic missile defenses 2 to take the initiative within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to develop consensus in the Alliance for a timely deployment of effective ballistic missile defenses by the Alliance and 3 in the interim to seek agreement with allies of the United States and selected other states on steps the parties should take consistent with their national interests to reduce the risks posed by the threat of limited ballistic missile attacks such steps to include — A the sharing of early warning information derived from sensors deployed by the United States and other states B the exchange on a reciprocal basis of technical data and technology to support both joint development programs and the sale and purchase of missile defense systems and components and C operational level planning to exploit current missile defense capabilities and to help define future requirements SEC
