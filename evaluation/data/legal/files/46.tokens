5 of the United States Code or on July 1 1970 whichever is later Message of the President To the Congress of the United States We in government often are quick to call for reform in other institutions but slow to reform ourselves Yet nowhere today is modern management more needed than in government itself In 1939 President Franklin D Roosevelt proposed and the Congress accepted a reorganization plan that laid the groundwork for providing managerial assistance for a modern Presidency The plan placed the Bureau of the Budget within the Executive Office of the President It made available to the President direct access to important new management instruments The purpose of the plan was to improve the administration of the Government — to ensure that the Government could perform promptly effectively without waste or lost motion Fulfilling that purpose today is far more difficult — and more important — than it was 30 years ago Last April I created a President s Advisory Council on Executive Organization and named to it a distinguished group of outstanding experts headed by Roy L Ash I gave the Council a broad charter to examine ways in which the Executive Branch could be better organized I asked it to recommend specific organizational changes that would make the Executive Branch a more vigorous and more effective instrument for creating and carrying out the programs that are needed today The Council quickly concluded that the place to begin was in the Executive Office of the President itself I agree The past 30 years have seen enormous changes in the size structure and functions of the Federal Government The budget has grown from less than $ 10 billion to $ 200 billion The number of civilian employees has risen from one million to more than two and a half million Four new Cabinet departments have been created along with more than a score of independent agencies Domestic policy issues have become increasingly complex The interrelationships among Government programs have become more intricate Yet the organization of the President s policy and management arms has not kept pace Over three decades the Executive Office of the President has mushroomed but not by conscious design In many areas it does not provide the kind of staff assistance and support the President needs in order to deal with the problems of government in the 1970s We confront the 1970s with a staff organization geared in large measure to the tasks of the 1940s and 1950s One result over the years has been a tendency to enlarge the immediate White House staff — that is the President s personal staff as distinct from the institutional structure — to assist with management functions for which the President is responsible This has blurred the distinction between personal staff and management institutions it has left key management functions to be performed only intermittently and some not at all It has perpetuated outdated structures Another result has been paradoxically to inhibit the delegation of authority to Departments and agencies A President whose programs are carefully coordinated whose information system keeps him adequately informed and whose organizational assignments are plainly set out can delegate authority with security and confidence A President whose office is deficient in these respects will be inclined instead to retain close control of operating responsibilities which he cannot and should not handle Improving the management processes of the President s own office therefore is a key element in improving the management of the entire Executive Branch and in strengthening the authority of its Departments and agencies By providing the tools that are needed to reduce duplication to monitor performance and to promote greater efficiency throughout the Executive Branch this also will enable us to give the country not only more effective but also more economical government — which it deserves To provide the management tools and policy mechanisms needed for the 1970s I am today transmitting to the Congress Reorganization Plan No 2 of 1970 prepared in accordance with Chapter 9 of Title 5 of the United States Code This plan draws not only on the work of the Ash Council itself but also on the work of others that preceded — including the pioneering Brownlow Committee of 1936 the two Hoover Commissions the Rockefeller Committee and other Presidential task forces Essentially the plan recognizes that two closely connected but basically separate functions both center in the President s office policy determination and executive management This involves 1 what government should do and 2 how it goes about doing it My proposed reorganization creates a new entity to deal with each of these functions — It establishes a Domestic Council to coordinate policy formulation in the domestic area This Cabinet group would be provided with an institutional staff and to a considerable degree would be a domestic counterpart to the National Security Council — It establishes an Office of Management and Budget which would be the President s principal arm for the exercise of his managerial functions The Domestic Council will be primarily concerned with what we do the Office of Management and Budget will be primarily concerned with how we do it and how well we do it DOMESTIC COUNCIL The past year s experience with the Council for Urban Affairs has shown how immensely valuable a Cabinet level council can be as a forum for both discussion and action on policy matters that cut across departmental jurisdictions The Domestic Council will be chaired by the President Under the plan its membership will include the Vice President and the Secretaries of the Treasury Interior Agriculture Commerce Labor Health Education and Welfare Housing and Urban Development and Transportation and the Attorney General I also intend to designate as members the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity and while he remains a member of the Cabinet the Postmaster General Although I continue to hope that the Congress will adopt my proposal to create in place of the Post Office Department a self sufficient postal authority The President could add other Executive Branch officials at his discretion The Council will be supported by a staff under an Executive Director who will also be one of the President s assistants Like the National Security Council staff this staff will work in close coordination with the President s personal staff but will have its own institutional identity By being established on a permanent institutional basis it will be designed to develop and employ the institutional memory so essential if continuity is to be maintained and if experience is to play its proper role in the policy making process There does not now exist an organized institutionally staffed group charged with advising the President on the total range of domestic policy The Domestic Council will fill that need Under the President s direction it will also be charged with integrating the various aspects of domestic policy into a consistent whole Among the specific policy functions in which I intend the Domestic Council to take the lead are these — Assessing national needs collecting information and developing forecasts for the purpose of defining national goals and objectives — Identifying alternative ways of achieving these objectives and recommending consistent integrated sets of policy choices — Providing rapid response to Presidential needs for policy advice on pressing domestic issues — Coordinating the establishment of national priorities for the allocation of available resources — Maintaining a continuous review of the conduct of ongoing programs from a policy standpoint and proposing reforms as needed Much of the Council s work will be accomplished by temporary ad hoc project committees These might take a variety of forms such as task forces planning groups or advisory bodies They can be established with varying degrees of formality and can be set up to deal either with broad program areas or with specific problems The committees will draw for staff support on Department and agency experts supplemented by the Council s own staff and that of the Office of Management and Budget Establishment of the Domestic Council draws on the experience gained during the past year with the Council for Urban Affairs the Cabinet Committee on the Environment and the Council for Rural Affairs The principal key to the operation of these Councils has been the effective functioning of their various subcommittees The Councils themselves will be consolidated into the Domestic Council Urban Rural and Environment subcommittees of the Domestic Council will be strengthened using access to the Domestic Council staff Overall the Domestic Council will provide the President with a streamlined consolidated domestic policy arm adequately staffed and highly flexible in its operation It also will provide a structure through which departmental initiatives can be more fully considered and expert advice from the Departments and agencies more fully utilized OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET Under the reorganization plan the technical and formal means by which the Office of Management and Budget is created is by re designating the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget The functions currently vested by law in the Bureau or in its director are transferred to the President with the provision that he can then re delegate them As soon as the reorganization plan takes effect I intend to delegate those statutory functions to the Director of the new Office of Management and Budget including those under section 212 of the Budget and Accounting Act 1921 [ 31 U S C 1113 ] However creation of the Office of Management and Budget represents far more than a mere change of name for the Bureau of the Budget It represents a basic change in concept and emphasis reflecting the broader management needs of the Office of the President The new Office will still perform the key function of assisting the President in the preparation of the annual Federal budget and overseeing its execution It will draw upon the skills and experience of the extraordinarily able and dedicated career staff developed by the Bureau of the Budget But preparation of the budget as such will no longer be its dominant overriding concern While the budget function remains a vital tool of management it will be strengthened by the greater emphasis the new office will place on fiscal analysis The budget function is only one of several important management tools that the President must now have He must also have a substantially enhanced institutional staff capability in other areas of executive management — particularly in program evaluation and coordination improvement of Executive Branch organization information and management systems and development of executive talent Under this plan strengthened capability in these areas will be provided partly through internal reorganization and it will also require additional staff resources The new Office of Management and Budget will place much greater emphasis on the evaluation of program performance on assessing the extent to which programs are actually achieving their intended results and delivering the intended services to the intended recipients This is needed on a continuing basis not as a one time effort Program evaluation will remain a function of the individual agencies as it is today However a single agency cannot fairly be expected to judge overall effectiveness in programs that cross agency lines — and the difference between agency and Presidential perspectives requires a capacity in the Executive Office to evaluate program performance whenever appropriate The new Office will expand efforts to improve interagency cooperation in the field Washington based coordinators will help work out interagency problems at the operating level and assist in developing efficient coordinating mechanisms throughout the country The success of these efforts depends on the experience persuasion and understanding of an Office which will be an expediter and catalyst The Office will also respond to requests from State and local governments for assistance on intergovernmental programs It will work closely with the Vice President and the Office of Intergovernmental Relations Improvement of Government organization information and management systems will be a major function of the Office of Management and Budget It will maintain a continuous review of the organizational structures and management processes of the Executive Branch and recommend needed changes It will take the lead in developing new information systems to provide the President with the performance and other data that he needs but does not now get When new programs are launched it will seek to ensure that they are not simply forced into or grafted onto existing organizational structures that may not be appropriate Resistance to organizational change is one of the chief obstacles to effective government the new Office will seek to ensure that organization keeps abreast of program needs The new Office will also take the lead in devising programs for the development of career executive talent throughout the Government Not the least of the President s needs as Chief Executive is direct capability in the Executive Office for insuring that talented executives are used to the full extent of their abilities Effective coordinated efforts for executive manpower development have been hampered by the lack of a system for forecasting the needs for executive talent and appraising leadership potential Both are crucial to the success of an enterprise — whether private or public The Office of Management and Budget will be charged with advising the President on the development of new programs to recruit train motivate deploy and evaluate the men and women who make up the top ranks of the civil service in the broadest sense of that term It will not deal with individuals but will rely on the talented professionals of the Civil Service Commission and the Departments and agencies themselves to administer these programs Under the leadership of the Office of Management and Budget there will be joint efforts to see to it that all executive talent is well utilized wherever it may be needed throughout the Executive Branch and to assure that executive training and motivation meet not only today s needs but those of the years ahead Finally the new Office will continue the Legislative Reference functions now performed by the Bureau of the Budget drawing together agency reactions on all proposed legislation and helping develop legislation to carry out the President s program It also will continue the Bureau s work of improving and coordinating Federal statistical services SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHANGES The people deserve a more responsive and more effective Government The times require it These changes will help provide it Each reorganization included in the plan which accompanies this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901 a of Title 5 of the United States Code In particular the plan is responsive to Section 901 a 1 to promote the better execution of the laws the more effective management of the Executive Branch and of its agencies and functions and the expeditious administration of the public business and Section 901 a 3 to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable The reorganizations provided for in this plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in Section 102 c of the plan The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the Executive Branch who have similar responsibilities While this plan will result in a modest increase in direct expenditures its strengthening of the Executive Office of the President will bring significant indirect savings and at the same time will help ensure that people actually receive the return they deserve for every dollar the Government spends The savings will result from the improved efficiency these changes will provide throughout the Executive Branch — and also from curtailing the waste that results when programs simply fail to achieve their objectives It is not practical however to itemize or aggregate these indirect expenditure reductions which will result from the reorganization I expect to follow with other reorganization plans quite possibly including ones that will affect other activities of the Executive Office of the President Our studies are continuing But this by itself is a reorganization of major significance and a key to the more effective functioning of the entire Executive Branch These changes would provide an improved system of policy making and coordination a strengthened capacity to perform those functions that are now the central concerns of the Bureau of the Budget and a more effective set of management tools for the performance of other functions that have been rapidly increasing in importance The reorganization will not only improve the staff resources available to the President but will also strengthen the advisory roles of those members of the Cabinet principally concerned with domestic affairs By providing a means of formulating integrated and systematic recommendations on major domestic policy issues the plan serves not only the needs of the President but also the interests of the Congress This reorganization plan is of major importance to the functioning of modern government The national interest requires it I urge that the Congress allow it to become effective Richard Nixon 12 1970 Abolition of Domestic Council Domestic Council established by Reorg Plan No 2 of 1970 § 201 eff July 1 1970 35 F

for Federal Infrastructure Investments Ex Ord No 12893 Jan 26 1994 59 F R 4233 provided A well functioning infrastructure is vital to sustained economic growth to the quality of life in our communities and to the protection of our environment and natural resources To develop and maintain its infrastructure facilities our Nation relies heavily on investments by the Federal Government Our Nation will achieve the greatest benefits from its infrastructure facilities if it invests wisely and continually improves the quality and performance of its infrastructure programs Therefore by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America it is hereby ordered as follows Section 1 Scope The principles and plans referred to in this order shall apply to Federal spending for infrastructure programs For the purposes of this order Federal spending for infrastructure programs shall include direct spending and grants for transportation water resources energy and environmental protection Sec 2 Principles of Federal Infrastructure Investment Each executive department and agency with infrastructure responsibilities hereinafter referred to collectively as agencies shall develop and implement plans for infrastructure investment and management consistent with the following principles a Systematic Analysis of Expected Benefits and Costs Infrastructure investments shall be based on systematic analysis of expected benefits and costs including both quantitative and qualitative measures in accordance with the following 1 Benefits and costs should be quantified and monetized to the maximum extent practicable All types of benefits and costs both market and nonmarket should be considered To the extent that environmental and other nonmarket benefits and costs can be quantified they shall be given the same weight as quantifiable market benefits and costs 2 Benefits and costs should be measured and appropriately discounted over the full life cycle of each project Such analysis will enable informed tradeoffs among capital outlays operating and maintenance costs and nonmonetary costs borne by the public 3 When the amount and timing of important benefits and costs are uncertain analyses shall recognize the uncertainty and address it through appropriate quantitative and qualitative assessments 4 Analyses shall compare a comprehensive set of options that include among other things managing demand repairing facilities and expanding facilities 5 Analyses should consider not only quantifiable measures of benefits and costs but also qualitative measures reflecting values that are not readily quantified b Efficient Management Infrastructure shall be managed efficiently in accordance with the following 1 The efficient use of infrastructure depends not only on physical design features but also on operational practices To improve these practices agencies should conduct periodic reviews of the operation and maintenance of existing facilities 2 Agencies should use these reviews to consider a variety of management practices that can improve the return from infrastructure investments Examples include contracting practices that reward quality and innovation and design standards that incorporate new technologies and construction techniques 3 Agencies also should use these reviews to identify the demand for different levels of infrastructure services Since efficient levels of service can often best be achieved by properly pricing infrastructure the Federal Government — through its direct investments grants and regulations — should promote consideration of market based mechanisms for managing infrastructure c Private Sector Participation Agencies shall seek private sector participation in infrastructure investment and management Innovative public private initiatives can bring about greater private sector participation in the ownership financing construction and operation of the infrastructure programs referred to in section 1 of this order Consistent with the public interest agencies should work with State and local entities to minimize legal and regulatory barriers to private sector participation in the provision of infrastructure facilities and services d Encouragement of More Effective State and Local Programs To promote the efficient use of Federal infrastructure funds agencies should encourage the State and local recipients of Federal grants to implement planning and information management systems that support the principles set forth in section 2 a through c of this order In turn the Federal Government should use the information from the State and local recipients management systems to conduct the system level reviews of the Federal Government s infrastructure programs that are required by this order Sec 3 Submission of Plans Agencies shall submit initial plans to implement these principles to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget OMB by March 15 1994 Agency plans shall list the actions that will be taken to provide the data and analysis necessary for supporting infrastructure related proposals in future budget submissions Agency implementation plans should be consistent with OMB Circular A – 94 that outlines the analytical methods required under the principles set forth in section 2 of this order Sec 4 Application to Budget Submissions Beginning with the fiscal year 1996 budget submission to OMB each agency should use these principles to justify major infrastructure investment and grant programs Major programs are defined as those programs with annual budgetary resources in excess of $ 50 million Sec 5 Application to Legislative Proposals Beginning March 15 1994 agencies shall employ the principles set forth in section 2 of this order and at the request of OMB shall provide supporting analyses when requesting OMB clearance for legislative proposals that would authorize or reauthorize infrastructure programs Sec 6 Guidance The Office of Management and Budget shall provide guidance to the agencies on the implementation of this order Sec 7 Judicial Review This order is intended only
