standards in the coal or other mine which are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of coal or other mine health or safety hazards he shall be given written notice that such pattern exists If upon any inspection within 90 days after the issuance of such notice an authorized representative of the Secretary finds any violation of a mandatory health or safety standard which could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard the authorized representative shall issue an order requiring the operator to cause all persons in the area affected by such violation except those persons referred to in subsection c to be withdrawn from and to be prohibited from entering such area until an authorized representative of the Secretary determines that such violation has been abated 2 If a withdrawal order with respect to any area in a coal or other mine has been issued pursuant to paragraph 1 a withdrawal order shall be issued by an authorized representative of the Secretary who finds upon any subsequent inspection the existence in such mine of any violation of a mandatory health or safety standard which could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal or other mine health or safety hazard The withdrawal order shall remain in effect until an authorized representative of the Secretary determines that such violation has been abated 3 If upon an inspection of the entire coal or other mine an authorized representative of the Secretary finds no violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal or other mine health and safety hazard the pattern of violations that resulted in the issuance of a notice under paragraph 1 shall be deemed to be terminated and the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall no longer apply However if as a result of subsequent violations the operator reestablishes a pattern of violations paragraphs 1 and 2 shall again be applicable to such operator 4 The Secretary shall make such rules

the concentration of respirable dust required to be maintained under this chapter is exceeded and thereby violated the Secretary or his authorized representative shall issue a citation fixing a reasonable time for the abatement of the violation During such time the operator of the mine shall cause samples described in section 842 a of this title to be taken of the affected area during each production shift If upon the expiration of the period of time as originally fixed or subsequently extended the Secretary or his authorized representative finds that the period of time should not be further extended he shall determine the extent of the area affected by the violation and shall promptly issue an order requiring the operator of such mine or his agent to cause immediately all persons except those referred to in subsection c to be withdrawn from and to be prohibited from entering such area until the Secretary or his authorized representative has reason to believe based on actions taken by the operator that such limit will be complied with upon the resumption of production in such mine As soon as possible after an order is issued the Secretary upon request of the operator shall dispatch to the mine involved a person or team of persons to the extent such persons are available who are knowledgeable in the methods and means of controlling and reducing respirable dust Such person or team of persons shall remain at the mine involved for such time as they shall deem appropriate to assist the operator in reducing respirable dust concentrations While at the mine such persons may require the operator to take such actions as they deem appropriate to insure the health of any person in the coal or other mine g Untrained miners 1 If upon any inspection or investigation pursuant to section 813 of this title the Secretary or an authorized representative shall find employed at a coal or other mine a miner who has not received the requisite safety training as determined
