and Revision Notes Based on title 13 U S C 1952 ed § 1 Mar 6 1902 ch 139 § 1 32 Stat 51 Feb 14 1903 ch 552 § 4 32 Stat 826 Mar 4 1913 ch 141 § 1 37 Stat 736 June 18 1929 ch 28 § 21 46 Stat 26 Section 1 of title 13 U S C 1952 ed provided that the Census Office temporarily established in the Department of the Interior in accordance with the act of Mar 3 1899 ch 419 30 Stat 1014 is made a permanent office in the Department of Commerce Such wording is no longer necessary and the provisions as revised in this section merely continue the Bureau of the Census as an agency within and under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce § 3 Seal The Bureau shall have a seal containing such device as has been selected heretofore or as the Secretary may select hereafter A description of such seal with an impression thereof shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State The seal shall remain in the custody of the Secretary or such officer or employee of the Bureau as he designates and shall be affixed to all documents authenticated by the Bureau Judicial notice shall be taken of the seal Aug 31 1954 ch 1158 68 Stat 1012 Pub L 85 – 207 § 2 Aug 28 1957 71 Stat 481 Pub L 94 – 521 § 2 Oct 17 1976 90 Stat 2459 Historical and Revision Notes Based on acts Mar 3 1899 ch 419 § 31 30 Stat 1021 Mar 6 1902 ch 139 § 6 32 Stat 52 Section is new to the United States Code but is in accordance with current practice Act Mar 3 1899 ch 419 30 Stat 1014 which established the Census Office on a temporary basis provided in section 31 thereof 30 Stat 1021 for a seal for that office The office was made permanent by act Mar 6 1902 ch 139 32 Stat 51 and section 6 of that act 32 Stat 52 continued in full force and effect for the taking of the Thirteenth and subsequent censuses all provisions of the act of Mar 3 1899 not inconsistent with the provisions of such 1902 act Therefore since the 1902 act contained no provisions with respect to a seal section 31 of the 1899 act providing for the seal remained in force as it was not inconsistent Section 33 of act July 2 1909 ch 2 36 Stat 10 which act 36 Stat 1 related to the Thirteenth and subsequent decennial censuses repealed the said act of Mar 3 1899 specifically and all other laws and parts of laws inconsistent with the provisions of the 1909 act These repealing provisions are somewhat ambiguous but it was probably the intent of Congress as it was the intent thereof at the time of enactment of the act of Mar 6 1902 referred to above to continue in effect all provisions of the act of Mar 3 1899 that were not inconsistent with the act of July 2 1909 The 1909 act contained no provisions with respect to the seal and it accordingly follows that the provisions of section 31 of the act of Mar 3 1899 with respect thereto continued in force This is also the interpretation of the Bureau of the Census which has continued to use a seal through the years in connection with certificates and attestations In any event this new section merely confirms past and present practice and restores if it does not preserve statutory authority for possession and use of the seal which is a very necessary part of the operations of the Bureau Further the section should serve to forestall future differences of interpretation In the past some States have refused to recognize the seal of the Census Bureau on the ground that it was not authorized by law In all probability this position was taken not as the result of a search of the Statutes at Large which would have been a difficult project but because provisions relating to the seal were not set out in the United States Code where they would have been readily accessible The language of this section follows substantially the language of section 31 of the act of Mar 3 1899 referred to above but has been reworded because of jurisdictional and other changes since that time The Census Office was transferred from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Commerce and Labor by act Feb 14 1903 ch 552 § 4 32 Stat 826 Act Mar 4 1913 ch 141 § 1 37 Stat 736 changed the name of the latter to the Department of Commerce and created as a separate department the Department of Labor It transferred a number of bureaus and agencies from the Department of Commerce to the Department of Labor but these transfers did not affect the Bureau of

Reorganization Plan The first paragraph of section 203 of title 13 U S C 1952 ed which provided for the employment of two assistant directors for each decennial census period was omitted as obsolete and superseded in view of section 122 of such title which made such section 203 applicable to the quinquennial censuses of manufactures and other businesses and to surveys see subchapter IV of chapter
