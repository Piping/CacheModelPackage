SUBCHAPTER V – A — CABLE COMMUNICATIONS Part I — General Provisions The purposes of this subchapter are to — 1 establish a national policy concerning cable communications 2 establish franchise procedures and standards which encourage the growth and development of cable systems and which assure that cable systems are responsive to the needs and interests of the local community 3 establish guidelines for the exercise of Federal State and local authority with respect to the regulation of cable systems 4 assure that cable communications provide and are encouraged to provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and services to the public 5 establish an orderly process for franchise renewal which protects cable operators against unfair denials of renewal where the operator s past performance and proposal for future performance meet the standards established by this subchapter and 6 promote competition in cable communications and minimize unnecessary regulation that would impose an undue economic burden on cable systems June 19 1934 ch 652 title VI § 601 as added Pub L 98 – 549 § 2 Oct 30 1984 98 Stat 2780 Effective Date Pub L 98 – 549 § 9 a Oct 30 1984 98

title section 2511 of Title 18 Crimes and Criminal Procedure and section 1805 of Title 50 War and National Defense and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 543 605 and 609 of this title ] and the amendments made thereby shall take effect 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act [ Oct 30 1984 ] Short Title For short title of Pub L 98 – 549 [ enacting this subchapter ] as the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 see section 1 a of Pub L 98 – 549 set out as a Short Title of 1984 Amendment note under section 609 of this title Congressional Findings and Policy for Pub L 102 – 385 Pub L 102 – 385 § 2 a b Oct 5 1992 106 Stat 1460 1463 provided that a Findings — The Congress finds and declares the following 1 Pursuant to the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 [ Pub L 98 – 549 enacting this subchapter and section 611 of this title amending sections 152 224 309 and 605 of this title section 2511 of Title 18 Crimes and Criminal Procedure and section 1805 of Title 50 War and National Defense and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 543 605 and 609 of this title ] rates for cable television services have been deregulated in approximately 97 percent of all franchises since December 29 1986 Since rate deregulation monthly rates for the lowest priced basic cable service have increased by 40 percent or more for 28 percent of cable television subscribers Although the average number of basic channels has increased from about 24 to 30 average monthly rates have increased by 29 percent during the same period The average monthly cable rate has increased almost 3 times as much as the Consumer Price Index since rate deregulation 2 For a variety of reasons including local franchising requirements and the extraordinary expense of constructing more than one cable television system to serve a particular geographic area most cable television subscribers have no opportunity to select between competing cable systems Without the presence of another multichannel video programming distributor a cable system faces no local competition The result is undue market power for the cable operator as compared to that of consumers and video programmers 3 There has been a substantial increase in the penetration of cable television systems over the past decade Nearly 56 000 000 households over 60 percent of the households with televisions subscribe to cable television and this percentage is almost certain to increase As a result of this growth the cable television industry has become a dominant nationwide video medium 4 The cable industry has become highly concentrated The potential effects of such concentration are barriers to entry for new programmers and a reduction in the number of media voices available to consumers 5 The cable industry has become vertically integrated cable operators and cable programmers often have common ownership As a result cable operators have the incentive and ability to favor their affiliated programmers This could make it more difficult for noncable affiliated programmers to secure carriage on cable systems Vertically integrated program suppliers also have the incentive and ability to favor their affiliated cable operators over nonaffiliated cable operators and programming distributors using other technologies 6 There is a substantial governmental and First Amendment interest in promoting a diversity of views provided through multiple technology media 7 There is a substantial governmental and First Amendment interest in ensuring that cable subscribers have access to local noncommercial educational stations which Congress has authorized as expressed in section 396 a 5 of the Communications Act of 1934 [ 47 U S C 396 a 5 ] The distribution of unique noncommercial educational programming services advances that interest 8 The Federal Government has a substantial interest in making all nonduplicative local public television services available on cable systems because — A public television provides educational and informational programming to the Nation s citizens thereby advancing the Government s compelling interest in educating its citizens B public television is a local community institution supported through local tax dollars and voluntary citizen contributions in excess of $ 10 800 000 000 since 1972 that provides public service programming that is responsive to the needs and interests of the local community C the Federal Government in recognition of public television s integral role in serving the educational and informational needs of local communities has invested more than $ 3 000 000 000 in public broadcasting since 1969 and D absent carriage requirements there is a substantial likelihood that citizens who have supported local public television services will be deprived of those services 9 The Federal Government has a substantial interest in having cable systems carry the signals of local commercial television stations because the carriage of such signals is necessary to serve the goals contained in section 307 b of the Communications Act of 1934 [ 47 U S C 307 b ] of providing a fair efficient and equitable distribution of broadcast services 10 A primary objective and benefit of our Nation s system of regulation of television broadcasting is the local origination of programming There is a substantial governmental interest in ensuring its continuation 11 Broadcast television stations continue to be an important source of local news and public affairs programming and other local broadcast services critical to an informed electorate 12 Broadcast television programming is supported by revenues generated from advertising broadcast over stations Such programming is otherwise free to those who own television sets and do not require cable transmission to receive broadcast signals There is a substantial governmental interest in promoting the continued availability of such free television programming especially for viewers who are unable to afford other means of receiving programming 13 As a result of the growth of cable television there has been a marked shift in market share from broadcast television to cable television services 14 Cable television systems and broadcast television stations increasingly compete for television advertising revenues As the proportion of households subscribing to cable television increases proportionately more advertising revenues will be reallocated from broadcast to cable television systems 15 A cable television system which carries the signal of a local television broadcaster is assisting the broadcaster to increase its viewership and thereby attract additional advertising revenues that otherwise might be earned by the cable system operator As a result there is an economic incentive for cable systems to terminate the retransmission of the broadcast signal refuse to carry new signals or reposition a broadcast signal to a disadvantageous channel position There is a substantial likelihood that absent the reimposition of such a requirement additional local broadcast signals will be deleted repositioned or not carried 16 As a result of the economic incentive that cable systems have to delete reposition or not carry local broadcast signals coupled with the absence of a requirement that such systems carry local broadcast signals the economic viability of free local broadcast television and its ability to originate quality local programming will be seriously jeopardized 17 Consumers who subscribe to cable television often do so to obtain local broadcast signals which they otherwise would not be able to receive or to obtain improved signals Most subscribers to cable television systems do not or cannot maintain antennas to receive broadcast television services do not have input selector switches to convert from a cable to antenna reception system or cannot otherwise receive broadcast television services The regulatory system created by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 was premised upon the continued existence of mandatory carriage obligations for cable systems ensuring that local stations would be protected from anticompetitive conduct by cable systems 18 Cable television systems often are the single most efficient distribution system for television programming A Government mandate for a substantial societal investment in alternative distribution systems for cable subscribers such as the A B input selector antenna system is not an enduring or feasible method of distribution and is not in the public interest 19 At the same time broadcast programming that is carried remains the most popular programming on cable systems and a substantial portion of the benefits for which consumers pay cable systems is derived from carriage of the signals of network affiliates independent television stations and public television stations Also cable programming placed on channels adjacent to popular off the air signals obtains a larger audience than on other channel positions Cable systems therefore obtain great benefits from local broadcast signals which until now they have been able to obtain without the consent of the broadcaster or any copyright liability This has resulted in an effective subsidy of the development of cable systems by local broadcasters While at one time when cable systems did not attempt to compete with local broadcasters for programming audience and advertising this subsidy may have been appropriate it is so no longer and results in a competitive imbalance between the 2 industries 20 The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 in its amendments to the Communications Act of 1934 [ 47 U S C 151 et seq ] limited the regulatory authority of franchising authorities over cable operators Franchising authorities are finding it difficult under the current regulatory scheme to deny renewals to cable systems that are not adequately serving cable subscribers 21 Cable systems should be encouraged to carry low power television stations licensed to the communities served by those systems where the low power station creates and broadcasts as a substantial part of its programming day local programming b Statement of Policy — It is the policy of the Congress in this Act [ enacting sections 334 335 534 to 537 544a 548 and 555a of this title amending sections 325 332 522 532 533 541 to 544 546 551 to 555 and 558 of this title and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 325 531 543 and 554 of this title ] to — 1 promote the availability to the public of a diversity of views and information through cable television and other video distribution media 2 rely on the marketplace to the maximum extent feasible to achieve that availability 3 ensure that cable operators continue to expand where economically justified their capacity and the programs offered over their cable systems 4 where cable television systems are not subject to effective competition ensure that consumer interests are protected in receipt of cable service and 5 ensure that cable television operators do not have undue market power vis a vis video programmers and consumers Sports Programming Migration Study and Report Pub L 102 – 385 § 26 Oct 5 1992 106 Stat 1502 directed Federal

section is to promote competition in the delivery of diverse sources of video programming and to assure that the widest possible diversity of information sources are made available to the public from cable systems in a manner consistent with growth and development of cable systems b Designation of channel capacity for commercial use 1 A cable operator shall designate channel capacity for commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the operator in accordance with the following requirements A An operator of any cable system with 36 or more but not more than 54 activated channels shall designate 10 percent of such channels which are not otherwise required for use or the use of which is not prohibited by Federal law or regulation B An operator of any cable system with 55 or more but not more than 100 activated channels shall designate 15 percent of such channels which are not otherwise required for use or the use of which is not prohibited by Federal law or regulation C An operator of any cable system with more than 100 activated channels shall designate 15 percent of all such channels D An operator of any cable system with fewer than 36 activated channels shall not be required to designate channel capacity for commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the operator unless the cable system is required to provide such channel capacity under the terms of a franchise in effect on October 30 1984 E An operator of any cable system in operation on October 30 1984 shall not be required to remove any service actually being provided on July 1 1984 in order to comply with this section but shall make channel capacity available for commercial use as such capacity becomes available until such time as the cable operator is in full compliance with this section 2 Any Federal agency State or franchising authority may not require any cable system to designate channel capacity for commercial use by unaffiliated persons in excess of the capacity specified in paragraph 1 except as otherwise provided in this section 3 A cable operator may not be required as part of a request for proposals or as part of a proposal for renewal subject to section 546 of this title to designate channel capacity for any use other than commercial use by unaffiliated persons under this section except as provided in sections 531 and 557 of this title but a cable operator may offer in a franchise or proposal for renewal thereof to provide consistent with applicable law such capacity for other than commercial use by such persons 4 A cable operator may use any unused channel capacity designated pursuant to this section until the use of such channel capacity is obtained pursuant to a written agreement by a person unaffiliated with the operator 5 For the purposes of this section the term commercial use means the provision of video programming whether or not for profit 6 Any channel capacity which has been designated for public educational or governmental use may not be considered as designated under this section for commercial use for purpose of this section c Use of channel capacity by unaffiliated persons editorial control restriction on service rules on rates terms and conditions 1 If a person unaffiliated with the cable operator seeks to use channel capacity designated pursuant to subsection b for commercial use the cable operator shall establish consistent with the purpose of this section and with rules prescribed by the Commission under paragraph 4 the price terms and conditions of such use which are at least sufficient to assure that such use will not adversely affect the operation financial condition or market development of the cable system 2 A cable operator shall not exercise any editorial control over any video programming provided pursuant to this section or in any other way consider the content of such programming except that a cable operator may refuse to transmit any leased access program or portion of a leased access program which contains obscenity indecency or nudity and may consider such content to the minimum extent necessary to establish a reasonable price for the commercial use of designated channel capacity by an unaffiliated person 3 Any cable system channel designated in accordance with this section shall not be used to provide a cable service that is being provided over such system on October 30 1984 if the provision of such programming is intended to avoid the purpose of this section 4 A The Commission shall have the authority to — i determine the maximum reasonable rates that a cable operator may establish pursuant to paragraph 1 for commercial use of designated channel capacity including the rate charged for the billing of rates to subscribers and for the collection of revenue from subscribers by the cable operator for such use ii establish reasonable terms and conditions for such use including those for billing and collection and iii establish procedures for the expedited resolution of disputes concerning rates or carriage under this section B Within 180 days after October 5 1992 the Commission shall establish rules for determining maximum reasonable rates under subparagraph A i for establishing terms and conditions under subparagraph A ii and for providing procedures under subparagraph A iii d Right of action in district court relief factors not to be considered by court Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable operator to make channel capacity available for use pursuant to this section may bring an action in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the cable system is located to compel that such capacity be made available If the court finds that the channel capacity sought by such person has not been made available in accordance with this section or finds that the price terms or conditions established by the cable operator are unreasonable the court may order such system to make available to such person the channel capacity sought and further determine the appropriate price terms or conditions for such use consistent with subsection c and may award actual damages if it deems such relief appropriate In any such action the court shall not consider any price term or condition established between an operator and an affiliate for comparable services e Petition to Commission relief 1 Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable operator to make channel capacity available pursuant to this section may petition the Commission for relief under this subsection upon a showing of prior adjudicated violations of this section Records of previous adjudications resulting in a court determination that the operator has violated this section shall be considered as sufficient for the showing necessary under this subsection If the Commission finds that the channel capacity sought by such person has not been made available in accordance with this section or that the price terms or conditions established by such system are unreasonable under subsection c the Commission shall by rule or order require such operator to make available such channel capacity under price terms and conditions consistent with subsection c 2 In any case in which the Commission finds that the prior adjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or practice of violations by an operator the Commission may also establish any further rule or order necessary to assure that the operator provides the diversity of information sources required by this section 3 In any case in

standards in that it is lewd lascivious filthy or indecent or is otherwise unprotected by the Constitution of the United States This subsection shall permit a cable operator to enforce prospectively a written and published policy of prohibiting programming that the cable operator reasonably believes describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards i Programming from qualified minority or educational programming sources 1 Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections b and c a cable operator required by this section to designate channel capacity for commercial use may use any such channel capacity for the provision of programming from a qualified minority programming source or from any qualified educational programming source whether or not such source is affiliated with the cable operator The channel capacity used to provide programming from a qualified minority programming source or from any qualified educational programming source pursuant to this subsection may not exceed 33 percent of the channel capacity designated pursuant to this section No programming provided over a cable

regulations establishing reasonable limits on the number of cable subscribers a person is authorized to reach through cable systems owned by such person or in which such person has an attributable interest B to prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable limits on the number of channels on a cable system that can be occupied by a video programmer in which a cable operator has an attributable interest and C to consider the necessity and appropriateness of imposing limitations on the degree to which multichannel video programming distributors may engage in the creation or production of video programming 2 In prescribing rules and regulations under paragraph 1 the Commission shall among other public interest objectives — A ensure that no cable operator or group of cable operators can unfairly impede either because of the size of any individual operator or because of joint actions by a group of operators of sufficient size the flow of video programming from the video programmer to the consumer B ensure that cable operators affiliated with video programmers do not favor such programmers in determining carriage on their cable systems or do not unreasonably restrict the flow of the video programming of such programmers to other video distributors C take particular account of the market structure ownership patterns and other relationships of the cable television industry including the nature and market power of the local franchise the joint ownership of cable systems and video programmers and the various types of non equity controlling interests D account for any efficiencies and other benefits that might be gained through increased ownership or control E make such rules and regulations reflect the dynamic nature of the communications marketplace F not impose limitations which would bar cable operators from serving previously unserved rural areas and G not impose limitations which would impair the development of diverse and high quality video programming g Combination of interests under prior law This section shall not apply to prohibit any combination of any interests held by any person on July 1 1984 to the extent of the interests so

provided by the system for carriage of any other type of signal B Advanced television At such time as the Commission prescribes modifications of the standards for television broadcast signals the Commission shall initiate a proceeding to establish any changes in the signal carriage requirements of cable television systems necessary to ensure cable carriage of such broadcast signals of local commercial television stations which have been changed to conform with such modified standards 5 Duplication not required Notwithstanding paragraph 1 a cable operator shall not be required to carry the signal of any local commercial television station that substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television station which is carried on its cable system or to carry the signals of more than one local commercial television station affiliated with a particular broadcast network as such term is defined by regulation If a cable operator elects to carry on its cable system a signal which substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television station carried on the cable system or to carry on its system the signals of more than one local commercial television station affiliated with a particular broadcast network all such signals shall be counted toward the number of signals the operator is required to carry under paragraph 1 6 Channel positioning Each signal carried in fulfillment of the carriage obligations of a cable operator under this section shall be carried on the cable system channel number on which the local commercial television station is broadcast over the air or on the channel on which it was carried on July 19 1985 or on the channel on which it was carried on January 1 1992 at the election of the station or on such other channel number as is mutually agreed upon by the station and the cable operator Any dispute regarding the positioning of a local commercial television station shall be resolved by the Commission 7 Signal availability Signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section shall be provided to every subscriber of a cable system Such signals shall be viewable via cable on all television receivers of a subscriber which are connected to a cable system by a cable operator or for which a cable operator provides a connection If a cable operator authorizes subscribers to install additional receiver connections but does not provide the subscriber with such connections or with the equipment and materials for such connections the operator shall notify such subscribers of all broadcast stations carried on the cable system which cannot be viewed via cable without a converter box and shall offer to sell or lease such a converter box to such subscribers at rates in accordance with section 543 b 3 of this title 8 Identification of signals carried A cable operator shall identify upon request by any person the signals carried on its system in fulfillment of the requirements of this section 9 Notification A cable operator shall provide written notice to a local commercial television station at least 30 days prior to either deleting from carriage or repositioning that station The notification provisions of this paragraph shall not be used to undermine or evade the channel positioning or carriage requirements imposed upon cable operators under this section 10 Compensation for carriage A cable operator shall not accept or request monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange either for carriage of local commercial television stations in fulfillment of the requirements of this section or for the channel positioning rights provided to such stations under this section except that — A any such station may be required to bear the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal or a baseband video signal to the principal headend of the cable system B a cable operator may accept payments from stations which would be considered distant signals under section 111 of title 17 as indemnification for any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage of such signal and C a cable operator may continue to accept monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange for carriage or channel positioning of the signal of any local commercial television station carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section through but not beyond the date of expiration of an agreement thereon between a cable operator and a local commercial television station entered into prior to June

that is predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials 2 Proceeding concerning certain stations Within 270 days after October 5 1992 the Commission notwithstanding prior proceedings to determine whether broadcast television stations that are predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials are serving the public interest convenience and necessity shall complete a proceeding in accordance with this paragraph to determine whether broadcast television stations that are predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials are serving the public interest convenience and necessity In conducting such proceeding the Commission shall provide appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment The Commission shall consider the viewing of such stations the level of competing demands for the spectrum allocated to such stations and the role of such stations in providing competition to nonbroadcast services offering similar programming In the event that the Commission concludes that one or more of such stations are serving the public interest convenience and necessity the Commission shall qualify such stations as local commercial television stations for purposes of subsection a In the event that the Commission concludes that one or more of such stations are not serving the public interest convenience and necessity the Commission shall allow the licensees of such stations a reasonable period within which to provide different programming and shall not deny such stations a renewal expectancy solely because their programming consisted predominantly of sales presentations or program length commercials h Definitions 1 Local commercial television station A In general For purposes of this section the term local commercial television station means any full power television broadcast station other than a qualified noncommercial educational television station within the meaning of section 535 l 1 of this title licensed and operating on a channel regularly assigned to its community by the Commission that with respect to a particular cable system is within the same television market as the cable system B Exclusions The term local commercial television station shall not include — i low power television stations television translator stations and passive repeaters which operate pursuant to part 74 of title 47 Code of Federal Regulations or any successor regulations thereto ii a television broadcast station that would be considered a distant signal under section 111 of title 17 if such station does not agree to indemnify the cable operator for any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage on the cable system or iii a television broadcast station that does not deliver to the principal headend of a cable system either a signal level of − 45dBm for UHF signals or − 49dBm for VHF signals at the input terminals of the signal processing equipment if such station does not agree to be responsible for the costs of delivering to the cable system a signal of good quality or a baseband video signal C Market determinations i For purposes of this section a broadcasting station s market shall be determined by the Commission by regulation or order using where available commercial publications which delineate television markets based on viewing patterns except that following a written request the Commission may with respect to a particular television broadcast station include additional communities within its television market or exclude communities from such station s television market to better effectuate the purposes of this section In considering such requests the Commission may determine that particular communities are part of more than one television market ii In considering requests filed pursuant to clause i the Commission shall afford particular attention to the value of localism by taking into account such factors as — I whether the station or other stations located in the same area have been historically carried on the cable system or systems within such community or on the satellite carrier or carriers serving such community II whether the television station provides coverage or other local service to such community III whether modifying the market of the television station would promote consumers access to television broadcast station signals that originate in their State of residence IV whether any other television station that is eligible to be carried by a cable system in such community in fulfillment of the requirements of this section provides news coverage of issues of concern to such community or provides carriage or coverage of sporting and other events of interest to the community and V evidence of viewing patterns in households that subscribe and do not subscribe to the services offered by multichannel video programming distributors within the areas served by such multichannel video programming distributors in such community iii A cable operator shall not delete from carriage the signal of a commercial television station during the pendency of any proceeding pursuant to this subparagraph iv Within 120 days after the date on which a request is filed under this subparagraph or 120 days after February 8 1996 if later the Commission shall grant or deny the request 2 Qualified low power station The term qualified low power station means any television broadcast station conforming to the rules established for Low Power Television Stations contained in part 74 of title 47 Code of Federal Regulations only if — A such station broadcasts for at least the minimum number of hours of operation required by the Commission for television broadcast stations under part 73 of title 47 Code of Federal Regulations B such station meets all obligations and requirements applicable to television broadcast stations under part 73 of title 47 Code of Federal Regulations with respect to the broadcast of nonentertainment programming programming and rates involving political candidates election issues controversial issues of public importance editorials and personal attacks programming for children and equal employment opportunity and the Commission determines that the provision of such programming by such station would address local news and informational needs which are not being adequately served by full power television broadcast stations because of the geographic distance of such full power stations from the low power station s community of license C such station complies with interference regulations consistent with its secondary status pursuant to part 74 of title 47 Code of Federal Regulations D such station is located no more than 35 miles from the cable system s headend and delivers to the principal headend of the cable system an over the air signal of good quality as determined by the Commission E the community of license of such station and the franchise area of the cable system are both located outside of the largest 160 Metropolitan Statistical Areas ranked by population as determined by the Office of Management and Budget on June 30 1990 and the population of such community of license on such date did not exceed 35 000 and F there is no full power television broadcast station licensed to any community within the county or other political subdivision of a State served by the cable system Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to change the secondary status of any low power station as provided in part 74 of title 47 Code of Federal Regulations as in effect on October 5 1992 June 19 1934 ch 652 title VI § 614 as added Pub L 102

service tier and other subscribers with regard to the rates charged for video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis B Exception limitation The prohibition in subparagraph A shall not apply to a cable system that by reason of the lack of addressable converter boxes or other technological limitations does not permit the operator to offer programming on a per channel or per program basis in the same manner required by subparagraph A This subparagraph shall not be available to any cable operator after — i the technology utilized by the cable system is modified or improved in a way that eliminates such technological limitation or ii 10 years after October 5 1992 subject to subparagraph C C Waiver If in any proceeding initiated at the request of any cable operator the Commission determines that compliance with the requirements of subparagraph A would require the cable operator to increase its rates the Commission may to the extent consistent with the public interest grant such cable operator a waiver from such requirements for such specified period as the Commission determines reasonable and appropriate c Regulation of unreasonable rates 1 Commission regulations Within 180 days after October 5 1992 the Commission shall by regulation establish the following A criteria prescribed in accordance with paragraph 2 for identifying in individual cases rates for cable programming services that are unreasonable B fair and expeditious procedures for the receipt consideration and resolution of complaints from any franchising authority in accordance with paragraph 3 alleging that a rate for cable programming services charged by a cable operator violates the criteria prescribed under subparagraph A which procedures shall include the minimum showing that shall be required for a complaint to obtain Commission consideration and resolution of whether the rate in question is unreasonable and C the procedures to be used to reduce rates for cable programming services that are determined by the Commission to be unreasonable and to refund such portion of the rates or charges that were paid by subscribers after the filing of the first complaint filed with the franchising authority under paragraph 3 and that are determined to be unreasonable 2 Factors to be considered In establishing the criteria for determining in individual cases whether rates for cable programming services are unreasonable under paragraph 1 A the Commission shall consider among other factors — A the rates for similarly situated cable systems offering comparable cable programming services taking into account similarities in facilities regulatory and governmental costs the number of subscribers and other relevant factors B the rates for cable systems if any that are subject to effective competition C the history of the rates for cable programming services of the system including the relationship of such rates to changes in general consumer prices D the rates as a whole for all the cable programming cable equipment and cable services provided by the system other than programming provided on a per channel or per program basis E capital and operating costs of the cable system including the quality and costs of the customer service provided by the cable system and F the revenues if any received by a cable operator from advertising from programming that is carried as part of the service for which a rate is being established and changes in such revenues or from other consideration obtained in connection with the cable programming services concerned 3 Review of rate changes The Commission shall review any complaint submitted by a franchising authority after February 8 1996 concerning an increase in rates for cable programming services and issue a final order within 90 days after it receives such a complaint unless the parties agree to extend the period for such review A franchising authority may not file a complaint under this paragraph unless within 90 days after such increase becomes effective it receives subscriber complaints 4 Sunset of upper tier rate regulation This subsection shall not apply to cable programming services provided after March 31 1999 d Uniform rate structure required A cable operator shall have a rate structure for the provision of cable service that is uniform throughout the geographic area in which cable service is provided over its cable system This subsection does not apply to 1 a cable operator with respect to the provision of cable service over its cable system in any geographic area in which the video programming services offered by the operator in that area are subject to effective competition or 2 any video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis Bulk discounts to multiple dwelling units shall not be subject to this subsection except that a cable operator of a cable system that is not subject to effective competition may not charge predatory prices to a multiple dwelling unit Upon a prima facie showing by a complainant that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the discounted price is predatory the cable system shall have the burden of showing that its discounted price is not predatory e Discrimination services for the hearing impaired Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting any Federal agency State or a franchising authority from — 1 prohibiting discrimination among subscribers and potential subscribers to cable service except that no Federal agency State or franchising authority may prohibit a cable operator from offering reasonable discounts to senior citizens or other economically disadvantaged group discounts or 2 requiring and regulating the installation or rental of equipment which facilitates the reception of cable service by hearing impaired individuals f Negative option billing prohibited A cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name For purposes of this subsection a subscriber s failure to refuse a cable operator s proposal to provide such service or equipment shall not be deemed to be an affirmative request for such service or equipment g Collection of information The Commission shall by regulation require cable operators to file with the Commission or a franchising authority as appropriate within one year after October 5 1992 and annually thereafter such financial information as may be needed for purposes of administering and enforcing this section h Prevention of evasions Within 180 days after October 5 1992 the Commission shall by regulation establish standards guidelines and procedures to prevent evasions including evasions that result from retiering of the requirements of this section and shall thereafter periodically review and revise such standards guidelines and procedures i Small system burdens In developing and prescribing regulations pursuant to this section the Commission shall design such regulations to reduce the administrative burdens and cost of compliance for cable systems that have 1 000 or fewer subscribers j Rate regulation agreements During the term of an agreement made before July 1 1990 by a franchising authority and a cable operator providing for the regulation of basic cable service rates where there was not effective competition under Commission rules in effect on that date nothing in this section or the regulations thereunder shall abridge the ability of such franchising authority to regulate rates in accordance with such an agreement k Reports on average prices 1 In general The Commission shall annually publish statistical reports on the average rates for basic cable service and other cable programming and for converter boxes remote control units and other equipment of cable systems that the Commission has found are subject to effective competition under subsection a 2 compared with cable systems that the Commission has found are not subject to such effective competition 2 Inclusion in annual report A In general The Commission shall include in its report under paragraph 1 the aggregate average total amount paid by cable systems in compensation under section 325 of this title B Form The Commission shall publish information under this paragraph in a manner substantially similar to the way other comparable information is published in such report l Definitions As used in this section — 1 The term effective competition means that — A fewer than 30 percent of the households in the franchise area subscribe to the cable service of a cable system B the franchise area is — i served by at least two unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors each of which offers comparable video programming to at least 50 percent of the households in the franchise area and ii the number of households subscribing to programming services offered by multichannel video programming distributors other than the largest multichannel video programming distributor exceeds 15 percent of the households in the franchise area C a multichannel video programming distributor operated by the franchising authority for that franchise area offers video programming to at least 50 percent of the households in that franchise area or D a local exchange carrier or its affiliate or any multichannel video programming distributor using the facilities of such carrier or its affiliate offers video programming services directly to subscribers by any means other than direct to home satellite services in the franchise area of an unaffiliated cable operator which is providing cable service in that franchise area but only if the video programming services so offered in that area are comparable to the video programming services provided by the unaffiliated cable operator in that area 2 The term cable programming service means any video programming provided over a cable system regardless of service tier including installation or rental of equipment used for the receipt of such video programming other than A video programming carried on the basic service tier and B video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis m Special rules for small companies 1 In general Subsections a b and c do not apply to a small cable operator with respect to — A

Consumer electronics equipment compatibility a Findings The Congress finds that — 1 new and recent models of television receivers and video cassette recorders often contain premium features and functions that are disabled or inhibited because of cable scrambling encoding or encryption technologies and devices including converter boxes and remote control devices required by cable operators to receive programming 2 if these problems are allowed to persist consumers will be less likely to purchase and electronics equipment manufacturers will be less likely to develop manufacture or offer for sale television receivers and video cassette recorders with new and innovative features and functions 3 cable operators should use technologies that will prevent signal thefts while permitting consumers to benefit from such features and functions in such receivers and recorders and 4 compatibility among televisions video cassette recorders and cable systems can be assured with narrow technical standards that mandate a minimum degree of common design and operation leaving all features functions protocols and other product and service options for selection through open competition in the market b Compatible interfaces 1 Report regulations Within 1 year after October 5 1992 the Commission in consultation with representatives of the cable industry and the consumer electronics industry shall report to Congress on means of assuring compatibility between televisions and video cassette recorders and cable systems consistent with the need to prevent theft of cable service so that cable subscribers will be able to enjoy the full benefit of both the programming available on cable systems and the functions available on their televisions and video cassette recorders Within 180 days after the date of submission of the report required by this subsection the Commission shall issue such regulations as are necessary to assure such compatibility 2 Scrambling and encryption In issuing the regulations referred to in paragraph 1 the Commission shall determine whether and if so under what circumstances to permit cable systems to scramble or encrypt signals or to restrict cable systems in the manner in which they encrypt or scramble signals except that the Commission shall not limit the use of scrambling or encryption technology where the use of such technology does not interfere with the functions of subscribers television receivers or video cassette recorders c Rulemaking requirements 1 Factors to be considered In prescribing the regulations required by this section the Commission shall consider — A the need to maximize open competition in the market for all features functions protocols and other product and service options of converter boxes and other cable converters unrelated to the descrambling or decryption of cable television signals B the costs and benefits to consumers of imposing compatibility requirements on cable operators and television manufacturers in a manner that while providing effective protection against theft or unauthorized reception of cable service will minimize interference with or nullification of the special functions of subscribers television receivers or video cassette recorders including functions that permit the subscriber — i to watch a program on one channel while simultaneously using a video cassette recorder to tape a program on another channel ii to use a video cassette recorder to tape two consecutive programs that appear on different channels and iii to use advanced television picture generation and display features and C the need for cable operators to protect the integrity of the signals transmitted by the cable operator against theft or to protect such signals against unauthorized reception 2 Regulations required The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this section shall include such regulations as are necessary — A to specify the technical requirements with which a television receiver or video cassette recorder must comply in order to be sold as cable compatible or cable ready B to require cable operators offering channels whose reception requires a converter box — i to notify subscribers that they may be unable to benefit from the special functions of their television receivers and video cassette recorders including functions that permit subscribers — I to watch a program on one channel while simultaneously using a video cassette recorder to tape a program on another channel II to use a video cassette recorder to tape two consecutive programs that appear on different channels and III to use advanced television picture generation and display features and ii to the extent technically and economically feasible to offer subscribers the option of having all other channels delivered directly to the subscribers television receivers or video cassette recorders without passing through the converter box C to promote the commercial availability from cable operators and retail vendors that are not affiliated with cable systems of converter boxes and of remote control devices compatible with converter boxes D to ensure that any standards or regulations developed under the authority of this section to ensure compatibility between televisions video cassette recorders and cable systems do not affect features functions protocols and other product and service options other than those specified in paragraph 1 B including telecommunications interface equipment home automation communications and computer network services E to require a cable operator who offers subscribers the option of renting a remote control unit — i to notify subscribers that they may purchase a commercially available remote control device from any source that sells such devices rather than renting it from the cable operator and ii to specify the types of remote control units that are compatible with the converter box supplied by the cable operator and F to prohibit a cable operator from taking any action that prevents or in any way disables the converter box supplied by the cable operator from operating compatibly with commercially available remote control units d Review of regulations The Commission shall periodically review and if necessary modify the regulations issued pursuant to this section in light of any actions taken in response to such regulations and to reflect improvements and changes in cable systems television receivers video cassette recorders and similar technology June 19 1934 ch 652 title VI § 624A as added

obtain from the franchising authority modifications of the requirements in such franchise — A in the case of any such requirement for facilities or equipment including public educational or governmental access facilities or equipment if the cable operator demonstrates that i it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply with such requirement and ii the proposal by the cable operator for modification of such requirement is appropriate because of commercial impracticability or B in the case of any such requirement for services if the cable operator demonstrates that the mix quality and level of services required by the franchise at the time it was granted will be maintained after such modification 2 Any final decision by a franchising authority under this subsection shall be made in a public proceeding Such decision shall be made within 120 days after receipt of such request by the franchising authority unless such 120 day period is extended by mutual agreement of the cable operator and the franchising authority b Judicial proceedings grounds for modification by court 1 Any cable operator whose request for modification under subsection a has been denied by a final decision of a franchising authority may obtain modification of such franchise requirements pursuant to the provisions of section 555 of this title 2 In the case of any proposed modification of a requirement for facilities or equipment the court shall grant such modification only if the cable operator demonstrates to the court that — A it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply with such requirement and B the terms of the modification requested are appropriate because of commercial impracticability 3 In the case of any proposed modification of a requirement for services the court shall grant such modification only if the cable operator demonstrates to the court that the mix quality and level of services required by the franchise at the time it was granted will be maintained after such modification c Rearrangement replacement or removal of service Notwithstanding subsections a and b a cable operator may upon 30 days advance notice to the franchising authority rearrange replace or remove a particular cable service required by the franchise if — 1 such service is no longer available to the operator or 2 such service is available to the operator only upon the payment of a royalty required under section 801 b 2 of title 17 which the cable operator can document — A is substantially in excess of the amount of such payment required on the date of the operator s offer to provide such service and B has not been specifically compensated for through a rate increase or other adjustment d Rearrangement of particular services from one service tier to another or other offering of service Notwithstanding subsections a and b a cable operator may take such actions to rearrange a particular service from one service tier to another or otherwise offer the service if the rates for all of the service tiers involved in such actions are not subject to regulation under section 543 of this title e Requirements for services relating to public educational or governmental access A cable operator may not obtain modification under this section of any requirement for services relating to public educational or governmental access f Commercially impracticable defined For purposes of this section the term commercially impracticable means with respect to any requirement applicable to a cable operator that it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply with such requirement as a result of a change in conditions which is beyond the control of the operator and the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the requirement was based June 19 1934 ch 652 title VI § 625 as added Pub L 98 – 549 § 2 Oct 30 1984 98 Stat 2790 Effective Date Section effective 60 days after Oct 30 1984 except where otherwise
