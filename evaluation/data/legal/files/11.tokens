In general — Except as provided under subparagraph B a distant signal equivalent — i is the value assigned to the secondary transmission of any non network television programming carried by a cable system in whole or in part beyond the local service area of the primary transmitter of such programming and ii is computed by assigning a value of one to each primary stream and to each multicast stream other than a simulcast that is an independent station and by assigning a value of one quarter to each primary stream and to each multicast stream other than a simulcast that is a network station or a noncommercial educational station B Exceptions — The values for independent network and noncommercial educational stations specified in subparagraph A are subject to the following i Where the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission require a cable system to omit the further transmission of a particular program and such rules and regulations also permit the substitution of another program embodying a performance or display of a work in place of the omitted transmission or where such rules and regulations in effect on the date of the enactment of the Copyright Act of 1976 2 permit a cable system at its election to effect such omission and substitution of a nonlive program or to carry additional programs not transmitted by primary transmitters within whose local service area the cable system is located no value shall be assigned for the substituted or additional program ii Where the rules regulations or authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on the date of the enactment of the Copyright Act of 1976 2 permit a cable system at its election to omit the further transmission of a particular program and such rules regulations or authorizations also permit the substitution of another program embodying a performance or display of a work in place of the omitted transmission the value assigned for the substituted or additional program shall be in the case of a live program the value of one full distant signal equivalent multiplied by a fraction that has as its numerator the number of days in the year in which such substitution occurs and as its denominator the number of days in the year iii In the case of the secondary transmission of a primary transmitter that is a television broadcast station pursuant to the late night or specialty programming rules of the Federal Communications Commission or the secondary transmission of a primary transmitter that is a television broadcast station on a part time basis where full time carriage is not possible because the cable system lacks the activated channel capacity to retransmit on a full time basis all signals that it is authorized to carry the values for independent network and noncommercial educational stations set forth in subparagraph A as the case may be shall be multiplied by a fraction that is equal to the ratio of the broadcast hours of such primary transmitter retransmitted by the cable system to the total broadcast hours of the primary transmitter iv No value shall be assigned for the secondary transmission of the primary stream or any multicast streams of a primary transmitter that is a television broadcast station in any community that is within the local service area of the primary transmitter 6 A Treatment of primary stream — The term network station shall be applied to a primary stream of a television broadcast station that is owned or operated by or affiliated with one or more of the television networks in the United States providing nationwide transmissions and that transmits a substantial part of the programming supplied by such networks for a substantial part of the primary stream s typical broadcast day B Treatment of multicast streams — The term network station shall be applied to a multicast stream on which a television broadcast station transmits all or substantially all of the programming of an interconnected program service that — i is owned or operated by or affiliated with one or more of the television networks described in subparagraph A and ii offers programming on a regular basis for 15 or more hours per week to at least 25 of the affiliated television licensees of the interconnected program service in 10 or more States 7 Independent station — The term independent station shall be applied to the primary stream or a multicast stream of a television broadcast station that is not a network station or a noncommercial educational station 8 Noncommercial educational station — The term noncommercial educational station shall be applied to the primary stream or a multicast stream of a television broadcast station that is a noncommercial educational broadcast station as defined in section 397 of the Communications Act of 1934 as in effect on the date of the enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 9 Primary stream — A primary stream is — A the single digital stream of programming that before June 12 2009 was substantially duplicating the programming transmitted by the television broadcast station as an analog signal or B if there is no stream described in subparagraph A then the single digital stream of programming transmitted by the television broadcast station for the longest period of time 10 Primary transmitter — A primary transmitter is a television or radio broadcast station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission or by an appropriate governmental authority of Canada or Mexico that makes primary transmissions to the public 11 Multicast stream — A multicast stream is a digital stream of programming that is transmitted by a television broadcast station and is not the station s primary stream 12 Simulcast — A simulcast is a multicast stream of a television broadcast station that duplicates the programming transmitted by the primary stream or another multicast stream of such station 13 A Subscriber — The term subscriber means a person or entity that receives a secondary transmission service from a cable system and pays a fee for the service directly or indirectly to the cable system B Subscribe — The term subscribe means to elect to become a subscriber Pub L 94 – 553 title I § 101 Oct 19 1976 90 Stat 2550 Pub L 99 – 397 §§ 1 2 a b Aug 27 1986 100

Historical and Revision Notes house report no 94 – 1476 Introduction and General Summary The complex and economically important problem of secondary transmissions is considered in section 111 For the most part the section is directed at the operation of cable television systems and the terms and conditions of their liability for the retransmission of copyrighted works However other forms of secondary transmissions are also considered including apartment house and hotel systems wired instructional systems common carriers nonprofit boosters and translators and secondary transmissions of primary transmissions to controlled groups Cable television systems are commercial subscription services that pick up broadcasts of programs originated by others and retransmit them to paying subscribers A typical system consists of a central antenna which receives and amplifies television signals and a network of cables through which the signals are transmitted to the receiving sets of individual subscribers In addition to an installation charge the subscribers pay a monthly charge for the basic service averaging about six dollars A large number of these systems provide automated programing A growing number of CATV systems also originate programs such as movies and sports and charge additional fees for this service pay cable The number of cable systems has grown very rapidly since their introduction in 1950 and now total about 3 450 operating systems servicing 7 700 communities Systems currently in operation reach about 10 8 million homes It is reported that the 1975 total subscriber revenues of the cable industry were approximately $ 770 million Pursuant to two decisions of the Supreme Court Fortnightly Corp v United Artist Television Inc 392 U S 390 1968 [ 88 S Ct 2084 20 L Ed 2d 1176 rehearing denied 89 S Ct 65 393 U S 902 21 L Ed 2d 190 ] and Teleprompter Corp v CBS Inc 415 U S 394 1974 [ 94 S Ct 1129 39 L Ed 2d 415 ] under the 1909 copyright law the cable television industry has not been paying copyright royalties for its retransmission of over the air broadcast signals Both decisions urged the Congress however to consider and determine the scope and extent of such liability in the pending revision bill The difficult problem of determining the copyright liability of cable television systems has been before the Congress since 1965 In 1967 this Committee sought to address and resolve the issues in H R 2512 an early version of the general revision bill see H R Rep No 83 90th Cong 1st Sess However largely because of the cable copyright impasse the bill died in the Senate The history of the attempts to find a solution to the problem since 1967 has been explored thoroughly in the voluminous hearings and testimony on the general revision bill and has also been succinctly summarized by the Register of Copyrights in her Second Supplementary Report Chapter V The Committee now has before it the Senate bill which contains a series of detailed and complex provisions which attempt to resolve the question of the copyright liability of cable television systems After extensive consideration of the Senate bill the arguments made during and after the hearings and of the issues involved this Committee has also concluded that there is no simple answer to the cable copyright controversy In particular any statutory scheme that imposes copyright liability on cable television systems must take account of the intricate and complicated rules and regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission to govern the cable television industry While the Committee has carefully avoided including in the bill any provisions which would interfere with the FCC s rules or which might be characterized as affecting communications policy the Committee has been cognizant of the interplay between the copyright and the communications elements of the legislation We would therefore caution the Federal Communications Commission and others who make determinations concerning communications policy not to rely upon any action of this Committee as a basis for any significant changes in the delicate balance of regulation in areas where the Congress has not resolved the issue Specifically we would urge the Federal Communications Commission to understand that it was not the intent of this bill to touch on issues such as pay cable regulation or increased use of imported distant signals These matters are ones of communications policy and should be left to the appropriate committees in the Congress for resolution In general the Committee believes that cable systems are commercial enterprises whose basic retransmission operations are based on the carriage of copyrighted program material and that copyright royalties should be paid by cable operators to the creators of such programs The Committee recognizes however that it would be impractical and unduly burdensome to require every cable system to negotiate with every copyright owner whose work was retransmitted by a cable system Accordingly the Committee has determined to maintain the basic principle of the Senate bill to establish a compulsory copyright license for the retransmission of those over the air broadcast signals that a cable system is authorized to carry pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC The compulsory license is conditioned however on certain requirements and limitations These include compliance with reporting requirements payment of the royalty fees established in the bill a ban on the substitution or deletion of commercial advertising and geographic limits on the compulsory license for copyrighted programs broadcast by Canadian or Mexican stations Failure to comply with these requirements and limitations subjects a cable system to a suit for copyright infringement and the remedies provided under the bill for such actions In setting a royalty fee schedule for the compulsory license the Committee determined that the initial schedule should be established in the bill It recognized however that adjustments to the schedule would be required from time to time Accordingly the Copyright Royalty Commission established in chapter 8 [§ 801 et seq of this title ] is empowered to make the adjustments in the initial rates at specified times based on standards and conditions set forth in the bill In setting an initial fee schedule the Senate bill based the royalty fee on a sliding scale related to the gross receipts of a cable system for providing the basic retransmission service and rejected a statutory scheme that would distinguish between local and distant signals The Committee determined however that there was no evidence that the retransmission of local broadcast signals by a cable operator threatens the existing market for copyright program owners Similarly the retransmission of network programing including network programing which is broadcast in distant markets does not injure the copyright owner The copyright owner contracts with the network on the basis of his programing reaching all markets served by the network and is compensated accordingly By contrast their retransmission of distant non network programing by cable systems causes damage to the copyright owner by distributing the program in an area beyond which it has been licensed Such retransmission adversely affects the ability of the copyright owner to exploit the work in the distant market It is also of direct benefit to the cable system by enhancing its ability to attract subscribers and increase revenues For these reasons the Committee has concluded that the copyright liability of cable television systems under the compulsory license should be limited to the retransmission of distant non network programing In implementing this conclusion the Committee generally followed a proposal submitted by the cable and motion picture industries the two industries most directly affected by the establishment of copyright royalties for cable television systems Under the proposal the royalty fee is determined by a two step computation First a value called a distant signal equivalent is assigned to all distant signals Distant signals are defined as signals retransmitted by a cable system in whole or in part outside the local service area of the primary transmitter Different values are assigned to independent network and educational stations because of the different amounts of viewing of non network programing carried by such stations For example the viewing of non network programs on network stations is considered to approximate 25 percent These values are then combined and a scale of percentages is applied to the cumulative total The Committee also considered various proposals to exempt certain categories of cable systems from royalty payments altogether The Committee determined that the approach of the Senate bill to require some payment by every cable system is sound but established separate fee schedules for cable systems whose gross receipts for the basic retransmission service do not exceed either $ 80 000 or $ 160 000 semiannually It is the Committee s view that the fee schedules adopted for these systems are now appropriate based on their relative size and the services performed All the royalty payments required under the bill are paid on a semiannual basis to the Register of Copyrights Each year they are distributed by the Copyright Royalty Commission to those copyright owners who may validly claim that their works were the subject of distant non network retransmissions by cable systems Based on current estimates supplied to the Committee the total royalty fees paid under the initial schedule established in the bill should approximate $ 8 7 million Compared with the present number of cable television subscribers calculated at 10 8 million copyright payments under the bill would therefore approximate 81 cents per subscriber per year The Committee believes that such payments are modest and will not retard the orderly development of the cable television industry or the service it provides to its subscribers Analysis of Provisions Throughout section 111 the operative terms are primary transmission and secondary transmission These terms are defined in subsection f entirely in relation to each other In any particular case the primary transmitter is the one whose signals are being picked up and further transmitted by a secondary transmitter which in turn is someone engaged in the further transmitting of a primary transmission simultaneously with the primary transmission With one exception provided in subsection f and limited by subsection e the section does not cover or permit a cable system or indeed any person to tape or otherwise record a program off the air and later to transmit the program from the tape or record to the public The one exception involves cable systems located outside the continental United States but not including cable systems in Puerto Rico or with limited exceptions Hawaii These systems are permitted to record and retransmit programs under the compulsory license subject to the restrictive conditions of subsection e because off the air signals are generally not available in the offshore areas General Exemptions Certain secondary transmissions are given a general exemption under clause 1 of section 111 a The first of these applies to secondary transmissions consisting entirely of the relaying by the management of a hotel apartment house or similar establishment of a transmission to the private lodgings of guests or residents and provided no direct charge is made to see or hear the secondary transmission The exemption would not apply if the secondary transmission consists of anything other than the mere relay of ordinary broadcasts The cutting out of advertising the running in of new commercials or any other change in the signal relayed would subject the secondary transmitter to full liability Moreover the term private lodgings is limited to rooms used as living quarters or for private parties and does not include dining rooms meeting halls theatres ballrooms or similar places that are outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances No special exception is needed to make clear that the mere placing of an ordinary radio or television set in a private hotel room does not constitute an infringement Secondary Transmissions of Instructional Broadcasts Clause 2 of section 111 a is intended to make clear that an instructional transmission within the scope of section 110 2 is exempt whether it is a primary transmission or a secondary transmission Carriers The general exemption under section 111 extends to secondary transmitters that act solely as passive carriers Under clause 3 a carrier is exempt if it has no direct or indirect control over the content or selection of the primary transmission or over the particular recipients of the secondary transmission For this purpose its activities must consist solely of providing wires cables or other communications channels for the use of others Clause 4 would exempt the activities of secondary transmitters that operate on a completely nonprofit basis The operations of nonprofit translators or boosters which do nothing more than amplify broadcast signals and retransmit them to everyone in an area for free reception would be exempt if there is no purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage and if there is no charge to the recipients other than assessments necessary to defray the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the secondary transmission service This exemption does not apply to a cable television system Secondary Transmissions of Primary Transmissions to Controlled Group Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections a and c the secondary transmission to the public of a primary transmission embodying a performance or display is actionable as an act of infringement if the primary transmission is not made for reception by the public at large but is controlled and limited to reception by particular members of the public Examples of transmissions not intended for the general public are background music services such as MUZAK closed circuit broadcasts to theatres pay television STV or pay cable The Senate bill contains a provision however stating that the secondary transmission does not constitute an act of infringement if the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary transmission is required under the rules and regulations of the FCC The exclusive purpose of this provision is to exempt a cable system from copyright liability if the FCC should require cable systems to carry to their subscribers a scrambled pay signal of a subscription television station The Committee is concerned however that the Senate bill is not clearly limited to the situation where a cable system is required by the FCC to carry a scrambled pay television signal The Committee believes that the provision should not include any authority or permission to unscramble the signal Further the Senate bill does not make clear that the exception would not apply if the primary transmission is made by a cable system or cable system network transmitting its own originated program e g pay cable For these reasons the subsection was amended to provide that the exception would only apply if 1 the primary transmission to a controlled group is made by a broadcast station licensed by the FCC 2 the carriage of the signal is required by FCC rules and regulations and 3 the signal of the primary transmitter is not altered or changed in any way by the secondary transmitter Compulsory License Section 111 c establishes the compulsory license for cable systems generally It provides that subject to the provisions of clauses 2 3 and 4 the secondary transmission to the public by a cable system of a primary transmission made by a broadcast station licensed by the FCC or by an appropriate governmental authority of Canada or Mexico is subject to compulsory licensing upon compliance with the provisions of subsection d where the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary transmission is permissible under the rules and regulations of the FCC The compulsory license applies therefore to the carriage of over the air broadcast signals and is inapplicable to the secondary transmission of any nonbroadcast primary transmission such as a program originated by a cable system or a cable network The latter would be subject to full copyright liability under other sections of the legislation Limitations on the Compulsory License Sections 111 c 2 3 and 4 establish limitations on the scope of the compulsory license and provide that failure to comply with these limitations subjects a cable system to a suit for infringement and all the remedies provided in the legislation for such actions Section 111 c 2 provides that the willful or repeated carriage of signals not permissible under the rules and regulations of the FCC subjects a cable system to full copyright liability The words willful or repeated are used to prevent a cable system from being subjected to severe penalties for innocent or casual acts Repeated does not mean merely more than once of course rather it denotes a degree of aggravated negligence which borders on willfulness Such a condition would not exist in the case of an innocent mistake as to what signals or programs may properly be carried under the FCC s complicated rules Section 111 c 2 also provides that a cable system is subject to full copyright liability where the cable system has not recorded the notice deposited the statement of account or paid the royalty fee required by subsection d The Committee does not intend however that a good faith error by the cable system in computing the amount due would subject it to full liability as an infringer The Committee expects that in most instances of this type the parties would be able to work out the problem without resort to the courts Commercial Substitution Section 111 c 3 provides that a cable system is fully subject to the remedies provided in this legislation for copyright infringement if the cable system willfully alters through changes deletions or additions the content of a particular program or any commercial advertising or station announcements transmitted by the primary transmitter during or immediately before or after the transmission of the program In the Committee s view any willful deletion substitution or insertion of commercial advertisements of any nature by a cable system or changes in the program content of the primary transmission significantly alters the basic nature of the cable retransmission service and makes its function similar to that of a broadcaster Further the placement of substitute advertising in a program by a cable system on a local signal harms the advertiser and in turn the copyright owner whose compensation for the work is directly related to the size of the audience that the advertiser s message is calculated to reach On a distant signal the placement of substitute advertising harms the local broadcaster in the distant market because the cable system is then competing for local advertising dollars without having comparable program costs The Committee has therefore attempted broadly to proscribe the availability of the compulsory license if a cable system substitutes commercial messages Included in the prohibition are commercial messages and station announcements not only during but also immediately before or after the program so as to insure a continuous ban on commercial substitution from one program to another In one situation however the Committee has permitted such substitution when the commercials are inserted by those engaged in television commercial advertising market research This exception is limited to those situations where the research company has obtained the consent of the advertiser who purchased the original commercial advertisement the television station whose signal is retransmitted and the cable system and provided further that no income is derived from the sale of such commercial time Canadian and Mexican Signals Section 111 c 4 provides limitations on the compulsory license with respect to foreign signals carried by cable systems from Canada or Mexico Under the Senate bill the carriage of any foreign signals by a cable system would have been subject to full copyright liability because the compulsory license was limited to the retransmission of broadcast stations licensed by the FCC The Committee recognized however that cable systems primarily along the northern and southern border have received authorization from the FCC to carry broadcast signals of certain Canadian and Mexican stations In the Committee s view the authorization by the FCC to a cable system to carry a foreign signal does not resolve the copyright question of the royalty payment that should be made for copyrighted programs originating in the foreign country The latter raises important international questions of the protection to be accorded foreign copyrighted works in the United States While the Committee has established a general compulsory licensing scheme for the retransmission of copyrighted works of U S nationals a broad compulsory license scheme for all foreign works does not appear warranted or justified Thus for example if in the future the signal of a British French or Japanese station were retransmitted in the United States by a cable system full copyright liability would apply With respect to Canadian and Mexican signals the Committee found that a special situation exists regarding the carriage of these signals by U S cable systems on the northern and southern borders respectively The Committee determined therefore that with respect to Canadian signals the compulsory license would apply in an area located 150 miles from the U S Canadian border or south from the border to the 42nd parallel of latitude whichever distance is greater Thus the cities of Detroit Pittsburgh Cleveland Green Bay and Seattle would be included within the compulsory license area while cities such as New York Philadelphia Chicago and San Francisco would be located outside the area With respect to Mexican signals the Commission determined that the compulsory license would apply only in the area in which such signals may be received by a U S cable system by means of direct interception of a free space radio wave Thus full copyright liability would apply if a cable system were required to use any equipment or device other than a receiving antenna to bring the signal to the community of the cable system Further to take account of those cable systems that are presently carrying or are specifically authorized to carry Canadian or Mexican signals pursuant to FCC rules and regulations and whether or not within the zones established the Committee determined to grant a compulsory license for the carriage of those specific signals on those cable systems as in effect on April 15 1976 The Committee wishes to stress that cable systems operating within these zones are fully subject to the payment of royalty fees under the compulsory license for those foreign signals retransmitted The copyright owners of the works transmitted may appear before the Copyright Royalty Commission and pursuant to the provisions of this legislation file claims to their fair share of the royalties collected Outside the zones however full copyright liability would apply as would all the remedies of the legislation for any act of infringement Requirements for a Compulsory License The compulsory license provided for in section 111 c is contingent upon fulfillment of the requirements set forth in section 111 d Subsection d 1 directs that at least one month before the commencement of operations or within 180 days after the enactment of this act [ Oct 19 1976 ] whichever is later a cable system must record in the Copyright Office a notice including a statement giving the identity and address of the person who owns or operates the secondary transmission service or who has power to exercise primary control over it together with the name and location of the primary transmitter whose signals are regularly carried by the cable system Signals regularly carried by the system mean those signals which the Federal Communications Commission has specifically authorized the cable system to carry and which are actually carried by the system on a regular basis It is also required that whenever the ownership or control or regular signal carriage complement of the system changes the cable system must within 30 days record any such changes in the Copyright Office Cable systems must also record such further information as the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation Subsection d 2 directs cable systems whose secondary transmissions have been subject to compulsory licensing under subsection c to deposit with the Register of Copyrights a semi annual statement of account The dates for filing such statements of account and the six month period which they are to cover are to be determined by the Register of Copyrights after consultation with the Copyright Royalty Commission In addition to other such information that the Register may prescribe by regulation the statements of account are to specify the number of channels on which the cable system made secondary transmissions to its subscribers the names and locations of all primary transmitters whose transmissions were carried by the system the total number of subscribers to the system and the gross amounts paid to the system for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions If any non network television programming was retransmitted by the cable system beyond the local service area of the primary transmitter pursuant to the rules of the Federal Communications Commission which under certain circumstances permit the substitution or addition of television signals not regularly carried the cable system must deposit a special statement of account listing the times dates stations and programs involved in such substituted or added carriage Copyright Royalty Payments Subsection d 2 B C and D require cable systems to deposit royalty fee payments for the period covered by the statements of account These payments are to be computed on the basis of specified percentages of the gross receipts from cable subscribers during the period covered by the statement For purposes of computing royalty payments only receipts for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters are to be considered Other receipts from subscribers such as those for pay cable services or installation charges are not included in gross receipts Subsection d 2 B provides that except in the case of a cable system that comes within the gross receipts limitations of subclauses C and D the royalty fee is computed in the following manner Every cable system pays 675 of 1 percent of its gross receipts for the privilege of retransmitting distant non network programming such amount to be applied against the fee if any payable under the computation for distant signal equivalents The latter are determined by adding together the values assigned to the actual number of distant television stations carried by a cable system The purpose of this initial rate applicable to all cable systems in this class is to establish a basic payment whether or not a particular cable system elects to transmit distant non network programming It is not a payment for the retransmission of purely local signals as is evident from the provision that it applies to and is deductible from the fee payable for any distant signal equivalents The remaining provisions of subclause B establish the following rates for distant signal equivalents The rate from zero to one distant signal equivalent is 675 of 1 percent of gross subscriber revenues An additional 425 of 1 percent of gross subscriber revenues is to be paid for each of the second third and fourth distant signal equivalents that are carried A further payment of 2 of 1 percent of gross subscriber revenues is to be made for each distant signal equivalent after the fourth Any fraction of a distant signal equivalent is to be computed at its fractional value and where a cable system is located partly within and partly without the local service area of a primary transmitter the gross receipts subject to the percentage payment are limited to those gross receipts derived from subscribers located without the local service area of such primary transmitter Pursuant to the foregoing formula copyright payments as a percentage of gross receipts increase as the number of distant television signals carried by a cable system increases Because many smaller cable systems carry a large number of distant signals especially those located in areas where over the air television service is sparse and because smaller cable systems may be less able to shoulder the burden of copyright payments than larger systems the Committee decided to give special consideration to cable systems with semi annual gross subscriber receipts of less than $ 160 000 $ 320 000 annually The royalty fee schedules for cable systems in this category are specified in subclauses C and D In lieu of the payments required in subclause B systems earning less than $ 80 000 semi annually are to pay a royalty fee of 5 of 1 percent of gross receipts Gross receipts under this provision are computed however by subtracting from actual gross receipts collected during the payment period the amount by which $ 80 000 exceeds such actual gross receipts Thus if the actual gross receipts of the cable system for the period covered are $ 60 000 the fee is determined by subtracting $ 20 000 the amount by which $ 80 000 exceeds actual gross receipts from $ 60 000 and applying 5 of 1 percent to the $ 40 000 result However gross receipts in no case are to be reduced to less than $ 3 000 Under subclause D cable systems with semi annual gross subscriber receipts of between $ 80 000 and $ 160 000 are to pay royalty fees of 5 of 1 percent of such actual gross receipts up to $ 80 000 and 1 percent of any actual gross receipts in excess of $ 80 000 The royalty fee payments under both subclauses C and D are to be determined without regard to the number of distant signal equivalents if any carried by the subject cable systems Copyright Royalty Distribution Section 111 d 3 provides that the royalty fees paid by cable systems under the compulsory license shall be received by the Register of Copyrights and after deducting the reasonable costs incurred by the Copyright Office deposited in the Treasury of the United States The fees are distributed subsequently pursuant to the determination of the Copyright Royalty Commission under chapter 8 [§ 801 et seq of this title ] The copyright owners entitled to participate in the distribution of the royalty fees paid by cable systems under the compulsory license are specified in section 111 d 4 Consistent with the Committee s view that copyright royalty fees should be made only for the retransmission of distant non network programming the claimants are limited to 1 copyright owners whose works were included in a secondary transmission made by a cable system of a distant non network television program 2 any copyright owner whose work is included in a secondary transmission identified in a special statement of account deposited under section 111 d 2 A and 3 any copyright owner whose work was included in distant non network programming consisting exclusively of aural signals Thus no royalty fees may be claimed or distributed to copyright owners for the retransmission of either local or network programs The Committee recognizes that the bill does not include specific provisions to guide the Copyright Royalty Commission in determining the appropriate division among competing copyright owners of the royalty fees collected from cable systems under Section 111 The Committee concluded that it would not be appropriate to specify particular limiting standards for distribution Rather the Committee believes that the Copyright Royalty Commission should consider all pertinent data and considerations presented by the claimants Should disputes arise however between the different classes of copyright claimants the Committee believes that the Copyright Royalty Commission should consider that with respect to the copyright owners of live programs identified by the special statement of account deposited under Section 111 d 2 A a special payment is provided in Section 111 f Section 111 d 5 sets forth the procedure for the distribution of the royalty fees paid by cable systems During the month of July of each year every person claiming to be entitled to compulsory license fees must file a claim with the Copyright Royalty Commission in accordance with such provisions as the Commission shall establish In particular the Commission may establish the relevant period covered by such claims after giving adequate time for copyright owners to review and consider the statements of account filed by cable systems Notwithstanding any provisions of the antitrust laws the claimants may agree among themselves as to the division and distribution of such fees After the first day of August of each year the Copyright Royalty Commission shall determine whether a controversy exists concerning the distribution of royalty fees If no controversy exists the Commission after deducting its reasonable administrative costs shall distribute the fees to the copyright owners entitled or their agents If the Commission finds the existence of a controversy it shall pursuant to the provisions of chapter 8 [§ 801 et seq of this title ] conduct a proceeding to determine the distribution of royalty fees Off Shore Taping by Cable Systems Section 111 e establishes the conditions and limitation upon which certain cable systems located outside the continental United States and specified in subsection f may make tapes of copyrighted programs and retransmit the taped programs to their subscribers upon payment of the compulsory license fee These conditions and limitations include compliance with detailed transmission record keeping and other requirements Their purpose is to control carefully the use of any tapes made pursuant to the limited recording and retransmission authority established in subsection f and to insure that the limited objective of assimilating offshore cable systems to systems within the United States for purposes of the compulsory license is not exceeded Any secondary transmission by a cable system entitled to the benefits of the taping authorization that does not comply with the requirements of section 111 e is an act of infringement and is fully subject to all the remedies provided in the legislation for such actions Definitions Section 111 f contains a series of definitions These definitions are found in subsection f rather than in section 101 because of their particular application to secondary transmissions by cable systems Primary and Secondary Transmissions The definitions of primary transmission and secondary transmission have been discussed above The definition of secondary transmission also contains a provision permitting the nonsimultaneous retransmission of a primary transmission if by a cable system not located in whole or in part within the boundary of the forty eight contiguous states Hawaii or Puerto Rico Under a proviso however a cable system in Hawaii may make a nonsimultaneous retransmission of a primary transmission if the carriage of the television broadcast signal comprising such further transmission is permissible under the rules regulations or authorizations of the FCC The effect of this definition is to permit certain cable systems in offshore areas but not including cable systems in the offshore area of Puerto Rico and to a limited extent only in Hawaii to tape programs and retransmit them to subscribers under the compulsory license Puerto Rico was excluded based upon a communication the Committee received from the Governor of Puerto Rico stating that the particular television broadcasting problems which the definition seeks to solve for cable systems in other noncontiguous areas do not exist in Puerto Rico He therefore requested that Puerto Rico be excluded from the scope of the definition All cable systems covered by the definition are subject to the conditions and limitations for nonsimultaneous transmissions established in section 111 e Cable System The definition of a cable system establishes that it is a facility that in whole or in part receives signals of one or more television broadcast stations licensed by the FCC and makes secondary transmissions of such signals to subscribing members of the public who pay for such service A closed circuit wire system that only originates programs and does not carry television broadcast signals would not come within the definition Further the definition provides that in determining the applicable royalty fee and system classification under subsection d 2 B C or D cable systems in contiguous communities under common ownership or control or operating from one headend are considered as one system Local Service Area of a Primary Transmitter The definition of local service area of a primary transmitter establishes the difference between local and distant signals and therefore the line between signals which are subject to payment under the compulsory license and those that are not It provides that the local service area of a television broadcast station is the area in which the station is entitled to insist upon its signal being retransmitted by a cable system pursuant to FCC rules and regulations Under FCC rules and regulations this so called must carry area is defined based on the market size and position of cable systems in 47 C F R §§ 76 57 76 59 76 61 and 76 63 The definition is limited however to the FCC rules in effect on April 15 1976 The purpose of this limitation is to insure that any subsequent rule amendments by the FCC that either increase or decrease the size of the local service area for its purposes do not change the definition for copyright purposes The Committee believes that any such change for copyright purposes which would materially affect the royalty fee payments provided in the legislation should only be made by an amendment to the statute The local service area of a primary transmitter of a Canadian or Mexican television station is defined as the area in which such station would be entitled to insist upon its signals being retransmitted if it were a television broadcast station subject to FCC rules and regulations Since the FCC does not permit a television station licensed in a foreign country to assert a claim to carriage by a U S cable system the local service area of such foreign station is considered to be the same area as if it were a U S station The local service area for a radio broadcast station is defined to mean the primary service area of such station pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission The term primary service area is defined precisely by the FCC with regard to AM stations in Section 73 11 a of the FCC s rules In the case of FM stations primary service area is regarded by the FCC as the area included within the field strength contours specified in Section 73 311 of its rules Distant Signal Equivalent The definition of a distant signal equivalent is central to the computation of the royalty fees payable under the compulsory license It is the value assigned to the secondary transmission of any non network television programming carried by a cable system in whole or in part beyond the local service area of the primary transmitter of such programming It is computed by assigning a value of one 1 to each distant independent station and a value of one quarter ¼ to each distant network station and distant noncommercial educational station carried by a cable system pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC Thus a cable system carrying two distant independent stations two distant network stations and one distant noncommercial educational station would have a total of 2 75 distant signal equivalents The values assigned to independent network and noncommercial educational stations are subject however to certain exceptions and limitations Two of these relate to the mandatory and discretionary program deletion and substitution rules of the FCC Where the FCC rules require a cable system to omit certain programs e g the syndicated program exclusivity rules and also permit the substitution of another program in place of the omitted program no additional value is assigned for the substituted or additional program Further where the FCC rules on the date of enactment of this legislation permit a cable system at its discretion to make such deletions or substitutions or to carry additional programs not transmitted by primary transmitters within whose local service area the cable system is located no additional value is assigned for the substituted or additional programs However the latter discretionary exception is subject to a condition that if the substituted or additional program is a live program e g a sports event then an additional value is assigned to the carriage of the distant signal computed as a fraction of one distant signal equivalent The fraction is determined by assigning to the numerator the number of days in the year on which the live substitution occurs and by assigning to the denominator the number of days in the year Further the discretionary exception is limited to those FCC rules in effect on the date of enactment of this legislation [ Oct 19 1976 ] If subsequent FCC rule amendments or individual authorizations enlarge the discretionary ability of cable systems to delete and substitute programs such deletions and substitutions would be counted at the full value assigned the particular type of station provided above Two further exceptions pertain to the late night or specialty programming rules of the FCC or to a station carried on a part time basis where full time carriage is not possible because the cable system lacks the activated channel capacity to retransmit on a full time basis all signals which it is authorized to carry In this event the values for independent network and noncommercial educational stations set forth above as the case may be are determined by multiplying each by a fraction which is equal to the ratio of the broadcast hours of such station carried by the cable system to the total broadcast hours of the station Network Station A network station is defined as a television broadcast station that is owned or operated by or affiliated with one or more of the U S television networks providing nationwide transmissions and that transmits a substantial part of the programming supplied by such networks for a substantial part of that station s typical broadcast day To qualify as a network station all the conditions of the definition must be met Thus the retransmission of a Canadian station affiliated with a Canadian network would not qualify under the definition Further a station affiliated with a regional network would not qualify since a regional network would not provide nationwide transmissions However a station affiliated with a network providing nationwide transmissions that also occasionally carries regional programs would qualify as a network station if the station transmits a substantial part of the programming supplied by the network for a substantial part of the station s typical broadcast day Independent Station An independent station is defined as a commercial television broadcast station other than a network station Any commercial station that does not fall within the definition of network station is classified as an independent station Noncommercial Educational Station A noncommercial educational station is defined as a television station that is a noncommercial educational broadcast station

note below § 112 Limitations on exclusive rights Ephemeral recordings a 1 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 and except in the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work it is not an infringement of copyright for a transmitting organization entitled to transmit to the public a performance or display of a work under a license including a statutory license under section 114 f or transfer of the copyright or under the limitations on exclusive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114 a or for a transmitting organization that is a broadcast radio or television station licensed as such by the Federal Communications Commission and that makes a broadcast transmission of a performance of a sound recording in a digital format on a nonsubscription basis to make no more than one copy or phonorecord of a particular transmission program embodying the performance or display if — A the copy or phonorecord is retained and used solely by the transmitting organization that made it and no further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from it and B the copy or phonorecord is used solely for the transmitting organization s own transmissions within its local service area or for purposes of archival preservation or security and C unless preserved exclusively for archival purposes the copy or phonorecord is destroyed within six months from the date the transmission program was first transmitted to the public 2 In a case in which a transmitting organization entitled to make a copy or phonorecord under paragraph 1 in connection with the transmission to the public of a performance or display of a work is prevented from making such copy or phonorecord by reason of the application by the copyright owner of technical measures that prevent the reproduction of the work the copyright owner shall make available to the transmitting organization the necessary means for permitting the making of such copy or phonorecord as permitted under that paragraph if it is technologically feasible and economically reasonable for the copyright owner to do so If the copyright owner fails to do so in a timely manner in light of the transmitting organization s reasonable business requirements the transmitting organization shall not be liable for a violation of section 1201 a 1 of this title for engaging in such activities as are necessary to make such copies or phonorecords as permitted under paragraph 1 of this subsection b Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 it is not an infringement of copyright for a governmental body or other nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance or display of a work under section 110 2 or under the limitations on exclusive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114 a to make no more than thirty copies or phonorecords of a particular transmission program embodying the performance or display if — 1 no further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from the copies or phonorecords made under this clause and 2 except for one copy or phonorecord that may be preserved exclusively for archival purposes the copies or phonorecords are destroyed within seven years from the date the transmission program was first transmitted to the public c Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 it is not an infringement of copyright for a governmental body or other nonprofit organization to make for distribution no more than one copy or phonorecord for each transmitting organization specified in clause 2 of this subsection of a particular transmission program embodying a performance of a nondramatic musical work of a religious nature or of a sound recording of such a musical work if — 1 there is no direct or indirect charge for making or distributing any such copies or phonorecords and 2 none of such copies or phonorecords is used for any performance other than a single transmission to the public by a transmitting organization entitled to transmit to the public a performance of the work under a license or transfer of the copyright and 3 except for one copy or phonorecord that may be preserved exclusively for archival purposes the copies or phonorecords are all destroyed within one year from the date the transmission program was first transmitted to the public d Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 it is not an infringement of copyright for a governmental body or other nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance of a work under section 110 8 to make no more than ten copies or phonorecords embodying the performance or to permit the use of any such copy or phonorecord by any governmental body or nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance of a work under section 110 8 if — 1 any such copy or phonorecord is retained and used solely by the organization that made it or by a governmental body or nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance of a work under section 110 8 and no further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from it and 2 any such copy or phonorecord is used solely for transmissions authorized under section 110 8 or for purposes of archival preservation or security and 3 the governmental body or nonprofit organization permitting any use of any such copy or phonorecord by any governmental body or nonprofit organization under this subsection does not make any charge for such use e Statutory License — 1 A transmitting organization entitled to transmit to the public a performance of a sound recording under the limitation on exclusive rights specified by section 114 d 1 C iv or under a statutory license in accordance with section 114 f is entitled to a statutory license under the conditions specified by this subsection to make no more than 1 phonorecord of the sound recording unless the terms and conditions of the statutory license allow for more if the following conditions are satisfied A The phonorecord is retained and used solely by the transmitting organization that made it and no further phonorecords are reproduced from it B The phonorecord is used solely for the transmitting organization s own transmissions originating in the United States under a statutory license in accordance with section 114 f or the limitation on exclusive rights specified by section 114 d 1 C iv C Unless preserved exclusively for purposes of archival preservation the phonorecord is destroyed within 6 months from the date the sound recording was first transmitted to the public using the phonorecord D Phonorecords of the sound recording have been distributed to the public under the authority of the copyright owner or the copyright owner authorizes the transmitting entity to transmit the sound recording and the transmitting entity makes the phonorecord under this subsection from a phonorecord lawfully made and acquired under the authority of the copyright owner 2 Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws any copyright owners of sound recordings and any transmitting organizations entitled to a statutory license under this subsection may negotiate and agree upon royalty rates and license terms and conditions for making phonorecords of such sound recordings under this section and the proportionate division of fees paid among copyright owners and may designate common agents to negotiate agree to pay or receive such royalty payments 3 Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable rates and terms of royalty payments for the activities specified by paragraph 1 during the 5 year period beginning on January 1 of the second year following the year in which the proceedings are to be commenced or such other period as the parties may agree Such rates shall include a minimum fee for each type of service offered by transmitting organizations Any copyright owners of sound recordings or any transmitting organizations entitled to a statutory license under this subsection may submit to the Copyright Royalty Judges licenses covering such activities with respect to such sound recordings The parties to each proceeding shall bear their own costs 4 The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges shall subject to paragraph 5 be binding on all copyright owners of sound recordings and transmitting organizations entitled to a statutory license under this subsection during the 5 year period specified in paragraph 3 or such other period as the parties may agree Such rates shall include a minimum fee for each type of service offered by transmitting organizations The Copyright Royalty Judges shall establish rates that most clearly represent the fees that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller In determining such rates and terms the Copyright Royalty Judges shall base their decision on economic competitive and programming information presented by the parties including — A whether use of the service may substitute for or may promote the sales of phonorecords or otherwise interferes with or enhances the copyright owner s traditional streams of revenue and B the relative roles of the copyright owner and the transmitting organization in the copyrighted work and the service made available to the public with respect to relative creative contribution technological contribution capital investment cost and risk In establishing such rates and terms the Copyright Royalty Judges may consider the rates and terms under voluntary license agreements described in paragraphs 2 and 3 The Copyright Royalty Judges shall also establish requirements by which copyright owners may receive reasonable notice of the use of their sound recordings under this section and under which records of such use shall be kept and made available by transmitting organizations entitled to obtain a statutory license under this subsection 5 License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time between 1 or more copyright owners of sound recordings and 1 or more transmitting organizations entitled to obtain a statutory license under this subsection shall be given effect in lieu of any decision by the Librarian of

by regulation and by paying royalty fees in accordance with this subsection or ii if such royalty fees have not been set by agreeing to pay such royalty fees as shall be determined in accordance with this subsection B Any royalty payments in arrears shall be made on or before the 20th day of the month next succeeding the month in which the royalty fees are set 7 If a transmitting organization entitled to make a phonorecord under this subsection is prevented from making such phonorecord by reason of the application by the copyright owner of technical measures that prevent the reproduction of the sound recording the copyright owner shall make available to the transmitting organization the necessary means for permitting the making of such phonorecord as permitted under this subsection if it is technologically feasible and economically reasonable for the copyright owner to do so If the copyright owner fails to do so in a timely manner in light of the transmitting organization s reasonable business requirements the transmitting organization shall not be liable for a violation of section 1201 a 1 of this title for engaging in such activities as are necessary to make such phonorecords as permitted under this subsection 8 Nothing in this subsection annuls limits impairs or otherwise affects in any way the existence or value of any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owners in a sound recording except as otherwise provided in this subsection or in a musical work including the exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute a sound recording or musical work including by means of a digital phonorecord delivery under sections 106 1 106 3 and 115 and the right to perform publicly a sound recording or musical work including by means of a digital audio transmission under sections 106 4 and 106 6 f 1 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 and without limiting the application of subsection b it is not an infringement of copyright for a governmental body or other nonprofit educational institution entitled under section 110 2 to transmit a performance or display to make copies or phonorecords of a work that is in digital form and solely to the extent permitted in paragraph 2 of a work that is in analog form embodying the performance or display to be used for making transmissions authorized under section 110 2 if — A such

digital formats except that such conversion is permitted hereunder only with respect to the amount of such works authorized to be performed or displayed under section 110 2 if — A no digital version of the work is available to the institution or B the digital version of the work that is available to the institution is subject to technological protection measures that prevent its use for section

no 94 – 1476 Section 112 of the bill concerns itself with a special problem that is not dealt with in the present statutes but is the subject of provisions in a number of foreign statutes and in the revisions of the Berne Convention since 1948 This is the problem of what are commonly called ephemeral recordings copies or phonorecords of a work made for purposes of later transmission by a broadcasting organization legally entitled to transmit the work In other words where a broadcaster has the privilege of performing or displaying a work either because he is licensed or because the performance or display is exempted under the statute the question is whether he should be given the additional privilege of recording the performance or display to facilitate its transmission The need for a limited exemption in these cases because of the practical exigencies of broadcasting has been generally recognized but the scope of the exemption has been a controversial issue Recordings for Licensed Transmissions Under subsection a of section 112 an organization that has acquired the right to transmit any work other than a motion picture or other audiovisual work or that is free to transmit a sound recording under section 114 may make a single copy or phonorecord of a particular program embodying the work if the copy or phonorecord is used solely for the organization s own transmissions within its own area after 6 months it must be destroyed or preserved solely for archival purposes Organizations Covered — The ephemeral recording privilege is given by subsection a to a transmitting organization entitled to transmit to the public a performance or display of a work Assuming that the transmission meets the other conditions of the provision it makes no difference what type of public transmission the organization is making commercial radio and television broadcasts public radio and television broadcasts not exempted by section 110 2 pay TV closed circuit background music and so forth However to come within the scope of subsection a the organization must have the right to make the transmission under a license or transfer of the copyright or under the limitations on exclusive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114 a Thus except in the case of copyrighted sound recordings which have no exclusive performing rights under the bill the organization must be a transferee or licensee including compulsory licensee of performing rights in the work in order to make an ephemeral recording of it Some concern has been expressed by authors and publishers lest the term organization be construed to include a number of affiliated broadcasters who could exchange the recording without restrictions The term is intended to cover a broadcasting network or a local broadcaster or individual transmitter but under clauses 1 and 2 of the subsection the ephemeral recording must be retained and used solely by the transmitting organization that made it and must be used solely for that organization s own transmissions within its own area Thus an ephemeral recording made by one transmitter whether it be a network or local broadcaster could not be made available for use by another transmitter Likewise this subsection does not apply to those nonsimultaneous transmissions by cable systems not located within a boundary of the forty eight contiguous States that are granted a compulsory license under section 111 Scope of the Privilege — Subsection a permits the transmitting organization to make no more than one copy or phonorecord of a particular transmission program embodying the performance or display A transmission program is defined in section 101 as a body of material produced for the sole purpose of transmission as a unit Thus under section 112 a a transmitter could make only one copy or phonorecord of a particular transmission program containing a copyrighted work but would not be limited as to the number of times the work itself could be duplicated as part of other transmission programs Three specific limitations on the scope of the ephemeral recording privilege are set out in subsection a and unless all are met the making of an ephemeral recording becomes fully actionable as an infringement The first requires that the copy or phonorecord be retained and used solely by the transmitting organization that made it and that no further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from it This means that a transmitting organization would have no privilege of exchanging ephemeral recordings with other transmitters or of allowing them to duplicate their own ephemeral recordings from the copy or phonorecord it has made There is nothing in the provision to prevent a transmitting organization from having an ephemeral recording made by means of facilities other than its own although it would not be permissible for a person or organization other than a transmitting organization to make a recording on its own initiative for possible sale or lease to a broadcaster The ephemeral recording privilege would extend to copies or phonorecords made in advance for later broadcast as well as recordings of a program that are made while it is being transmitted and are intended for deferred transmission or preservation Clause 2 of section 112 a provides that to be exempt from copyright the copy or phonorecord must be used solely for the transmitting organization s own transmissions within its local service area or for purposes of archival preservation or security The term local service area is defined in section 111 f Clause 3 of section 112 a provides that unless preserved exclusively for archival purposes the copy or phonorecord of a transmission program must be destroyed within six months from the date the transmission program was first transmitted to the public Recordings for Instructional Transmissions Section 112 b represents a response to the arguments of instructional broadcasters and other educational groups for special recording privileges although it does not go as far as these groups requested In general it permits a nonprofit organization that is free to transmit a performance or display of a work under section 110 2 or under the limitations on exclusive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114 a to make not more than thirty copies or phonorecords and to use the ephemeral recordings for transmitting purposes for not more than seven years after the initial transmission Organizations Covered — The privilege of making ephemeral recordings under section 112 b extends to a governmental body or other nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance or display of a work under section 110 2 or under the limitations on exclusive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114 a Aside from phonorecords of copyrighted sound recordings the ephemeral recordings made by an instructional broadcaster under subsection b must embody a performance or display that meets all of the qualifications for exemption under section 110 2 Copies or phonorecords made for educational broadcasts of a general cultural nature or for transmission as part of an information storage and retrieval system would not be exempted from copyright protection under section 112 b Motion Pictures and Other Audiovisual Works — Since the performance exemption provided by section 110 2 applies only to nondramatic literary and musical works there was no need to exclude motion pictures and other audiovisual works explicitly from the scope of section 112 b Another point stressed by the producers of educational films in this connection however was that ephemeral recordings made by instructional broadcasters are in fact audiovisual works that often compete for exactly the same market They argued that it is unfair to allow instructional broadcasters to reproduce multiple copies of films and tapes and to exchange them with other broadcasters without paying any copyright royalties thereby directly injuring the market of producers of audiovisual works who now pay substantial fees to authors for the same uses These arguments are persuasive and justify the placing of reasonable limits on the recording privilege Scope of the Privilege — Under subsection b an instructional broadcaster may make no more than thirty copies or phonorecords of a particular transmission program embodying the performance or display No further copies or phonorecords can be reproduced from those made under section 112 b either by the nonprofit organization that made them or by anyone else On the other hand if the nonprofit organization does nothing directly or indirectly to authorize induce or encourage others to duplicate additional copies or phonorecords of an ephemeral recording in excess of the limit of thirty it would not be held responsible as participating in the infringement in such a case and the unauthorized copies would not be counted against the organization s total of thirty Unlike ephemeral recordings made under subsection a exchanges of recordings among instructional broadcasters are permitted An organization that has made copies or phonorecords under subsection b may use one of them for purposes of its own transmissions that are exempted by section 110 2 and it may also transfer the other 29 copies to other instructional broadcasters for use in the same way As in the case of ephemeral recordings made under section 112 a a copy or phonorecord made for instructional broadcasting could be reused in any number of transmissions within the time limits specified in the provision Because of the special problems of instructional broadcasters resulting from the scheduling of courses and the need to prerecord well in advance of transmission the period of use has been extended to seven years from the date the transmission program was first transmitted to the public Religious Broadcasts — Section 112 c provides that it is not an infringement of copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to make no more than one copy for each transmitting organization of a broadcast program embodying a performance of a nondramatic musical work of a religious nature or of a sound recording of such a musical work In order for this exception to be applicable there must be no charge for the distribution of the copies none of the copies may be used for any performance other than a single transmission by an organization possessing a license to transmit a copyrighted work and other than for one copy that may be preserved for archival purposes the remaining copies must be destroyed within one year from the date the program was first transmitted to the public Despite objections by music copyright owners the Committee found this exemption to be justified by the special circumstances under which many religious programs are broadcast These programs are produced on tape or disk for distribution by mail of one copy only to each broadcast station carrying the program None of the programs are prepared for profit and the program producer either pays the station to carry the program or furnishes it free of charge The stations have performing licenses so the copyright owners receive compensation Following the performance the tape is returned or the disk destroyed It seems likely that as has been alleged to require a second payment for the mechanical reproduction under these circumstances would simply have the effect of driving some of the copyrighted music off the air Ephemeral Recordings for Transmissions to Handicapped Audiences As a counterpart to its amendment of section 110 8 the Committee adopted a new provision subsection d of section 112 to provide an ephemeral recording exemption in the case of transmissions to the blind and deaf New subsection would permit the making of one recording of a performance exempted under section 110 8 and its retention for an unlimited period It would not permit the making of further reproductions or their exchange with other organizations Copyright Status of Ephemeral Recordings A program reproduced in an ephemeral recording made under section 112 in many cases will constitute a motion picture a sound recording or some other kind of derivative work and will thus be potentially copyrightable under section 103 In section 112 e it is provided that ephemeral recordings are not to be copyrightable as derivative works except with the consent of the owners of the copyrighted material employed in them Amendments 2004 — Subsec e 3 Pub L

exclusive right to reproduce a copyrighted pictorial graphic or sculptural work in copies under section 106 includes the right to reproduce the work in or on any kind of article whether useful or otherwise b This title does not afford to the owner of copyright in a work that portrays a useful article as such any greater or lesser rights with respect to the making distribution or display of the useful article so portrayed than those afforded to such works under the law whether title 17 or the common law or statutes of a State in effect on December 31 1977 as held applicable and construed by a court in an action brought under this title c In the case of a work lawfully reproduced in useful articles that have been offered for sale or other distribution to the public copyright does not include any right to prevent the making distribution or display of pictures or photographs of such articles in connection with advertisements or commentaries related to the distribution or display of such articles or in connection with news reports d 1 In a case in which — A a work of visual art has been incorporated in or made part of a building in such a way that removing the work from the

either before the effective date set forth in section 610 a of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 or in a written instrument executed on or after such effective date that is signed by the owner of

1476 Section 113 deals with the extent of copyright protection in works of applied art The section takes as its starting point the Supreme Court s decision in Mazer v Stein 347 U S 201 1954 [ 74 S Ct 460 98 L Ed 630 rehearing denied 74 S Ct 637 347 U S 949 98 L Ed 1096 ] and the first sentence of subsection a restates the basic principle established by that decision The rule of Mazer as affirmed by the bill is that copyright in a pictorial graphic or sculptural work will not be affected if the work is employed as the design of a useful article and will afford protection to the copyright owner against the unauthorized reproduction of his work in useful as well as nonuseful articles The terms pictorial graphic and sculptural works and useful article are defined in section 101 and these definitions are discussed above in connection with section 102 The broad language of section 106 1 and of subsection a of section 113 raises questions as to the extent of copyright protection for a pictorial graphic or sculptural work that portrays depicts or represents an image of a useful article in such a way that the utilitarian nature of the article can be seen To take the example usually cited would copyright in a drawing or model of an automobile give the artist the exclusive right to make automobiles of the same design The 1961 Report of the Register of Copyrights stated on the basis of judicial precedent that copyright in a pictorial graphic or sculptural work portraying a useful article as such does not extend to the manufacture of the useful article itself and recommended specifically that the distinctions drawn in this area by existing court decisions not be altered by the statute The Register s Supplementary Report at page 48 cited a number of these decisions and explained the insuperable difficulty of finding any statutory formulation that would express the distinction satisfactorily Section 113 b reflects the Register s conclusion that the real need is to make clear that there is no intention to change the present law with respect to the scope of protection in a work portraying a useful article as such Section 113 c provides that it would not be an

to provide to the public such audio or other entertainment programming and the primary purpose of the service is not to sell advertise or promote particular products or services other than sound recordings live concerts or other music related events 7 An interactive service is one that enables a member of the public to receive a transmission of a program specially created for the recipient or on request a transmission of a particular sound recording whether or not as part of a program which is selected by or on behalf of the recipient The ability of individuals to request that particular sound recordings be performed for reception by the public at large or in the case of a subscription service by all subscribers of the service does not make a service interactive if the programming on each channel of the service does not substantially consist of sound recordings that are performed within 1 hour of the request or at a time designated by either the transmitting entity or the individual making such request If an entity offers both interactive and noninteractive services either concurrently or at different times the noninteractive component shall not be treated as part of an interactive service 8 A new subscription service is a service that performs sound recordings by means of noninteractive subscription digital audio transmissions and that is not a preexisting subscription service or a preexisting satellite digital audio radio service 9 A nonsubscription transmission is any transmission that is not a subscription transmission 10 A preexisting satellite digital audio radio service is a subscription satellite digital audio radio service provided pursuant to a satellite digital audio radio service license issued by the Federal Communications Commission on or before July 31 1998 and any renewal of such license to the extent of the scope of the original license and may include a limited number of sample channels representative of the subscription service that are made available on a nonsubscription basis in order to promote the subscription service 11 A preexisting subscription service is a service that performs sound recordings by means of noninteractive audio only subscription digital audio transmissions which was in existence and was making such transmissions to the public for a fee on or before July 31 1998 and may include a limited number of sample channels representative of the subscription service that are made available on a nonsubscription basis in order to promote the subscription service 12 A retransmission is a further transmission of an initial transmission and includes any further retransmission of the same transmission Except as provided in this section a transmission qualifies as a retransmission only if it is simultaneous with the initial transmission Nothing in this definition shall be construed to exempt a transmission that fails to satisfy a separate element required to qualify for an exemption under section 114 d 1 13 The sound recording performance complement is the transmission during any 3 hour period on a particular channel used by a transmitting entity of no more than — A 3 different selections of sound recordings from any one phonorecord lawfully distributed for public performance or sale in the United States if no more than 2 such selections are transmitted consecutively or B 4 different selections of sound recordings — i by the same featured recording artist or ii from any set or compilation of phonorecords lawfully distributed together as a unit for public performance or sale in the United States if no more than three such selections are transmitted consecutively Provided That the transmission of selections in excess of the numerical limits provided for in clauses A and B from multiple phonorecords shall nonetheless qualify as a sound recording performance complement if the programming of the multiple phonorecords was not willfully intended to avoid the numerical limitations prescribed in such clauses 14 A subscription transmission is a transmission that is controlled and limited to particular recipients and for which consideration is required to be paid or otherwise given by or on behalf of the recipient to receive the transmission or a package of transmissions including the transmission 15 A transmission is either an initial transmission or a retransmission Pub L 94 – 553 title I § 101 Oct 19 1976 90 Stat 2560 Pub L 104 – 39 § 3 Nov 1 1995 109 Stat 336 Pub L 105 – 80 § 3 Nov 13 1997 111 Stat 1531 Pub L 105 – 304 title IV § 405 a 1 – 4 Oct

Section 114 specified that the exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording are limited to the rights to reproduce the sound recording in copies or phonorecords to prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted sound recording and to distribute copies or phonorecords of the sound recording to the public Subsection a states explicitly that the owner s rights do not include any right of performance under section 106 4 The Committee considered at length the arguments in favor of establishing a limited performance right in the form of a compulsory license for copyrighted sound recordings but concluded that the problem requires further study It therefore added a new subsection d to the bill requiring the Register of Copyrights to submit to Congress on January 3 1978 a report setting forth recommendations as to whether this section should be amended to provide for performers and copyright owners * * * any performance rights in copyrighted sound recordings Under the new subsection the report should describe the status of such rights in foreign countries the views of major interested parties and specific legislative or other recommendations if any Subsection b of section 114 makes clear that statutory protection for sound recordings extends only to the particular sounds of which the recording consists and would not prevent a separate recording of another performance in which those sounds are imitated Thus infringement takes place whenever all or any substantial portion of the actual sounds that go to make up a copyrighted sound recording are reproduced in phonorecords by repressing transcribing recapturing off the air or any other method or by reproducing them in the soundtrack or audio portion of a motion picture or other audiovisual work Mere imitation of a recorded performance would not constitute a copyright infringement even where one performer deliberately sets out to simulate another s performance as exactly as possible Under section 114 the exclusive right of owner of copyright in a sound recording to prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted sound recording is recognized However in view of the expressed intention not to give exclusive rights against imitative or simulated performances and recordings the Committee adopted an amendment to make clear the scope of rights under section 106 2 in this context Section 114 b provides that the exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause 2 of section 106 is limited to the right to prepare a derivative work in which the actual sounds fixed in the sound recording are rearranged remixed or otherwise altered in sequence or quality Another amendment deals with the use of copyrighted sound recordings included in educational television and radio programs * * * distributed or transmitted by or through public broadcasting entities This use of recordings is permissible without authorization from the owner of copyright in the sound recording as long as copies or phonorecords of said programs are not commercially distributed by or through public broadcasting entities to the general public During the 1975 hearings the Register of Copyrights expressed some concern that an invaluable segment of this country s musical heritage — in the form of sound recordings — had become inaccessible to musicologists and to others for scholarly purposes Several of the major recording companies have responded to the Register s concern by granting blanket licenses to the Library of Congress to permit it to make single copy duplications of sound recordings maintained in the Library s archives for research purposes Moreover steps are being taken to determine the feasibility of additional licensing arrangements as a means of satisfying the needs of key regional music libraries across the country The Register has agreed to report to Congress if further legislative consideration should be undertaken Section 114 c states explicitly that nothing in the provisions of section 114 should be construed to limit or impair the exclusive right to perform publicly by means of a phonorecord any of the works specified by section 106 4 This principle is already implicit in the bill but it is restated to avoid the danger of confusion between rights in a sound recording and rights in the musical composition or other work embodied in the recording References in Text Section 602 12 of the Communications Act of 1934 referred to in subsec d 1 C iii was subsequently amended and section 602 12 no longer

in the copyright arbitration royalty panel proceeding leading to the July 8 2002 order of the Librarian of Congress establishing rates and terms for certain digital performances and ephemeral reproductions of sound recordings as provided in part 261 of the Code of Federal Regulations published in the Federal Register on July 8 2002 referred to in this section as small webcasters have expressed reservations about the fee structure set forth in such order and have expressed their desire for a fee based on a percentage of revenue 2 Congress has strongly encouraged representatives of copyright owners of sound recordings and representatives of the small webcasters to engage in negotiations to arrive at an agreement that would include a fee based on a percentage of revenue 3 The representatives have arrived at an agreement that they can accept in the extraordinary and unique circumstances here presented specifically as to the small webcasters their belief in their inability to pay the fees due pursuant to the July 8 order and as to the copyright owners of sound recordings and performers the strong encouragement of Congress to reach an accommodation with the small webcasters on an expedited basis 4 The representatives have indicated that they do not believe the agreement provides for or in any way approximates fair or reasonable royalty rates and terms or rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller 5 Congress has made no determination as to whether the agreement provides for or in any way approximates fair or reasonable fees and terms or rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller 6 Congress likewise has made no determination as to whether the July 8 order is reasonable or arbitrary and nothing in this Act [ amending this section and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and section 101 of this title ] shall be taken into account by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in its review of such order 7 It is nevertheless in the public interest for the parties to be able to enter into such an agreement without fear of liability for deviating from the fees and terms of the July 8 order if it is clear that the agreement will not be admissible as

a Dec 4 2002 116 Stat 2783 provided that Congress finds that — 1 in the case of royalty payments from the licensing of digital transmissions of sound recordings under subsection f of section 114 of title 17 United States Code the parties have voluntarily negotiated arrangements under which payments shall be made directly to featured recording artists and the administrators of the accounts provided in subsection g 2 of that section 2 such voluntarily negotiated payment arrangements have been codified in regulations issued by the Librarian of Congress currently found in section 261 4 of title 37 Code of Federal Regulations as published in the Federal Register on July 8 2002 3 other regulations issued by the Librarian of Congress were inconsistent with the voluntarily negotiated arrangements by such parties concerning the deductibility of certain costs incurred for licensing and arbitration and Congress is therefore restoring those terms as originally negotiated among the parties and 4 in light of the special circumstances described in this subsection the uncertainty created by the regulations issued by the Librarian of Congress and the fact that all of the interested

followed by Reform § 115 Scope of exclusive rights in nondramatic musical works Compulsory license for making and distributing phonorecords In the case of nondramatic musical works the exclusive rights provided by clauses 1 and 3 of section 106 to make and to distribute phonorecords of such works are subject to compulsory licensing under the conditions specified by this section a Availability and Scope of Compulsory License — 1 When phonorecords of a nondramatic musical work have been distributed to the public in the United States under the authority of the copyright owner any other person including those who make phonorecords or digital phonorecord deliveries may by complying with the provisions of this section obtain a compulsory license to make and distribute phonorecords of the work A person may obtain a compulsory license only if his or her primary purpose in making phonorecords is to distribute them to the public for private use including by means of a digital phonorecord delivery A person may not obtain a compulsory license for use of the work in the making of phonorecords duplicating a sound recording fixed by another unless i such sound recording was fixed lawfully and ii the making of the phonorecords was authorized by the owner of copyright in the sound recording or if the sound recording was fixed before February 15 1972 by any person who fixed the sound recording pursuant to an express license from the owner of the copyright in the musical work or pursuant to a valid compulsory license for use of such work in a sound recording 2 A compulsory license includes the privilege of making a musical arrangement of the work to the extent necessary to conform it to the style or manner of interpretation of the performance involved but the arrangement shall not change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work and shall not be subject to protection as a derivative work under this title except with the express consent of the copyright owner b Notice of Intention To Obtain Compulsory License — 1 Any person who wishes to obtain a compulsory license under this section shall before or within thirty days after making and before distributing any phonorecords of the work serve notice of intention to do so on the copyright owner If the registration or other public records of the Copyright Office do not identify the copyright owner and include an address at which notice can be served it shall be sufficient to file the notice of intention in the Copyright Office The notice shall comply in form content and manner of service with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation 2 Failure to serve or file the notice required by clause 1 forecloses the possibility of a compulsory license and in the absence of a negotiated license renders the making and distribution of phonorecords actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506 and 509 c Royalty Payable Under Compulsory License — 1 To be entitled to receive royalties under a compulsory license the copyright owner must be identified in the registration or other public records of the Copyright Office The owner is entitled to royalties for phonorecords made and distributed after being so identified but is not entitled to recover for any phonorecords previously made and distributed 2 Except as provided by clause 1 the royalty under a compulsory license shall be payable for every phonorecord made and distributed in accordance with the license For this purpose and other than as provided in paragraph 3 a phonorecord is considered distributed if the person exercising the compulsory license has voluntarily and permanently parted with its possession With respect to each work embodied in the phonorecord the royalty shall be either two and three fourths cents or one half of one cent per minute of playing time or fraction thereof whichever amount is larger 3 A A compulsory license under this section includes the right of the compulsory licensee to distribute or authorize the distribution of a phonorecord of a nondramatic musical work by means of a digital transmission which constitutes a digital phonorecord delivery regardless of whether the digital transmission is also a public performance of the sound recording under section 106 6 of this title or of any nondramatic musical work embodied therein under section 106 4 of this title For every digital phonorecord delivery by or under the authority of the compulsory licensee — i on or before December 31 1997 the royalty payable by the compulsory licensee shall be the royalty prescribed under paragraph 2 and chapter 8 of this title and ii on or after January 1 1998 the royalty payable by the compulsory licensee shall be the royalty prescribed under subparagraphs B through E and chapter 8 of this title B Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws any copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection a 1 may negotiate and agree upon the terms and rates of royalty payments under this section and the proportionate division of fees paid among copyright owners and may designate common agents on a nonexclusive basis to negotiate agree to pay or receive such royalty payments Such authority to negotiate the terms and rates of royalty payments includes but is not limited to the authority to negotiate the year during which the royalty rates prescribed under this subparagraph and subparagraphs C through E and chapter 8 of this title shall next be determined C Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable rates and terms of royalty payments for the activities specified by this section during the period beginning with the effective date of such rates and terms but not earlier than January 1 of the second year following the year in which the petition requesting the proceeding is filed and ending on the effective date of successor rates and terms or such other period as the parties may agree Such terms and rates shall distinguish between i digital phonorecord deliveries where the reproduction or distribution of a phonorecord is incidental to the transmission which constitutes the digital phonorecord delivery and ii digital phonorecord deliveries in general Any copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection a 1 may submit to the Copyright Royalty Judges licenses covering such activities The parties to each proceeding shall bear their own costs D The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges shall subject to subparagraph E be binding on all copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection a 1 during the period specified in subparagraph C such other period as may be determined pursuant to subparagraphs B and C or such other period as the parties may agree Such terms and rates shall distinguish between i digital phonorecord deliveries where the reproduction or distribution of a phonorecord is incidental to the transmission which constitutes the digital phonorecord delivery and ii digital phonorecord deliveries in general In addition to the objectives set forth in section 801 b 1 in establishing such rates and terms the Copyright Royalty Judges may consider rates and terms under voluntary license agreements described in subparagraphs B and C The royalty rates payable for a compulsory license for a digital phonorecord delivery under this section shall be established de novo and no precedential effect shall be given to the amount of the royalty payable by a compulsory licensee for digital phonorecord deliveries on or before December 31 1997 The Copyright Royalty Judges shall also establish requirements by which copyright owners may receive reasonable notice of the use of their works under this section and under which records of such use shall be kept and made available by persons making digital phonorecord deliveries E i License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time between one or more copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and one or more persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection a 1 shall be given effect in lieu of any determination by the Librarian of Congress and Copyright Royalty Judges Subject to clause ii the royalty rates determined pursuant to subparagraph 1 C and D shall be given effect as to digital phonorecord deliveries in lieu of any contrary royalty rates specified in a contract pursuant to which a recording artist who is the author of a nondramatic musical work grants a license under that person s exclusive rights in the musical work under paragraphs 1 and 3 of section 106 or commits another person to grant a license in that musical work under paragraphs 1 and 3 of section 106 to a person desiring to fix in a tangible medium of expression a sound recording embodying the musical work ii The second sentence of clause i shall not apply to — I a contract entered into on or before June 22 1995 and not modified thereafter for the purpose of reducing the royalty rates determined pursuant to subparagraph 1 C and D or of increasing the number of musical works within the scope of the contract covered by the reduced rates except if a contract entered into on or before June 22 1995 is modified thereafter for the purpose of increasing the number of musical works within the scope of the contract any contrary royalty rates specified in the contract shall be given effect in lieu of royalty rates determined pursuant to subparagraph 1 C and D for the number of musical works within the scope of the contract as of June 22 1995 and II a contract entered into after the date that the sound recording is fixed in a tangible medium of expression substantially in a form intended for commercial release if at the time the contract is entered into the recording artist retains the right to grant licenses as to the musical work under paragraphs 1 and 3 of section 106 F Except as provided in section 1002 e of this title a digital phonorecord delivery licensed under this paragraph shall be accompanied by the information encoded in the sound recording if any by or under the authority of the copyright owner of that sound recording that identifies the title of the sound recording the featured recording artist who performs on the sound recording and related information including information concerning the underlying musical work and its writer G i A digital phonorecord delivery of a sound recording is actionable as an act of infringement under section 501 and is fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506 unless — I the digital phonorecord delivery has been authorized by the copyright owner of the sound recording and II the owner of the copyright in the sound recording or the entity making the digital phonorecord delivery has obtained a compulsory license under this section or has otherwise been authorized by the copyright owner of the musical work to distribute or authorize the distribution by means of a digital phonorecord delivery of each musical work embodied in the sound recording ii Any cause of action under this subparagraph shall be in addition to those available to the owner of the copyright in the nondramatic musical work under subsection c 6 and section 106 4 and the owner of the copyright in the sound recording under section 106 6 H The liability of the copyright owner of a sound recording for infringement of the copyright in a nondramatic musical work embodied in the sound recording shall be determined in accordance with applicable law except that the owner of a copyright in a sound recording shall not be liable for a digital phonorecord delivery by a third party if the owner of the copyright in the sound recording does not license the distribution of a phonorecord of the nondramatic musical work I Nothing in section 1008 shall be construed to prevent the exercise of the rights and remedies allowed by this paragraph paragraph 6 and chapter 5 in the event of a digital phonorecord delivery except that no action alleging infringement of copyright may be brought under this title against a manufacturer importer or distributor of a digital audio recording device a digital audio recording medium an analog recording device or an analog recording medium or against a consumer based on the actions described in such section J Nothing in this section annuls or limits i the exclusive right to publicly perform a sound recording or the musical work embodied therein including by means of a digital transmission under sections 106 4 and 106 6 ii except for compulsory licensing under the conditions specified by this section the exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the sound recording and the musical work embodied therein under sections 106 1 and 106 3 including by means of a digital phonorecord delivery or iii any other rights under any other provision of section 106 or remedies available under this title as such rights or remedies exist either before or after the date of enactment of the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 K The provisions of this section concerning digital phonorecord deliveries shall not apply to any exempt transmissions or retransmissions under section 114 d 1 The exemptions created in section 114 d 1 do not expand or reduce the rights of copyright owners under section 106 1 through 5 with respect to such transmissions and retransmissions 4 A compulsory license under this section includes the right of the maker of a phonorecord of a nondramatic musical work under subsection a 1 to distribute or authorize distribution of such phonorecord by rental lease or lending or by acts or practices in the nature of rental lease or lending In addition to any royalty payable under clause 2 and chapter 8 of this title a royalty shall be payable by the compulsory licensee for every act of distribution of a phonorecord by or in the nature of rental lease or lending by or under the authority of the compulsory licensee With respect to each nondramatic musical work embodied in the phonorecord the royalty shall be a proportion of the revenue received by the compulsory licensee from every such act of distribution of the phonorecord under this clause equal to the proportion of the revenue received by the compulsory licensee from distribution of the phonorecord under clause 2 that is payable by a compulsory licensee under that clause and under chapter 8 The Register of Copyrights shall issue regulations to carry out the purpose of this clause 5 Royalty payments shall be made on or before the twentieth day of each month and shall include all royalties for the month next preceding Each monthly payment shall be made under oath and shall comply with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation The Register shall also prescribe regulations under which detailed cumulative annual statements of account certified by a certified public accountant shall be filed for every compulsory license under this section The regulations covering both the monthly and the annual statements of account shall prescribe the form content and manner of certification with respect to the number of records made and the number of records distributed 6 If the copyright owner does not receive the monthly payment and the monthly and annual statements of account when due the owner may give written notice to the licensee that unless the default is remedied within thirty days from the date of the notice the compulsory license will be automatically terminated Such termination renders either the making or the distribution or both of all phonorecords for which the royalty has not been paid actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506 d Definition — As used in this section the following term has the following meaning A digital phonorecord delivery is each individual delivery of a phonorecord by digital transmission of a sound recording which results in a specifically identifiable reproduction by or for any transmission recipient of a phonorecord of that sound recording regardless of whether the digital transmission is also a public performance of the sound recording or any nondramatic musical work embodied therein A digital phonorecord delivery does not result from a real time non interactive subscription transmission of a sound recording where no reproduction of the sound recording or the musical work embodied therein is made from the inception of the transmission through to its receipt by the transmission recipient in order to make the sound recording audible Pub L 94 – 553 title I § 101 Oct 19 1976 90 Stat 2561 Pub L 98 – 450 § 3 Oct 4 1984 98 Stat 1727 Pub L 104 – 39 § 4 Nov 1 1995 109 Stat 344 Pub L 105 – 80 §§ 4 10 12 a 7 Nov 13 1997

9 2010 124 Stat 3181 Historical and Revision Notes house report no 94 – 1476 The provisions of section 1 e and 101 e of the present law [ sections 1 e and 101 e of former title 17 ] establishing a system of compulsory licensing for the making and distribution of phonorecords of copyrighted music are retained with a number of modifications and clarifications in section 115 of the bill Under these provisions which represented a compromise of the most controversial issue of the 1909 act a musical composition that has been reproduced in phonorecords with the permission of the copyright owner may generally be reproduced in phonorecords by another person if that person notifies the copyright owner and pays a specified royalty The fundamental question of whether to retain the compulsory license or to do away with it altogether was a major issue during earlier stages of the program for general revision of the copyright law At the hearings it was apparent that the argument on this point had shifted and the real issue was not whether to retain the compulsory license but how much the royalty rate under it should be The arguments for and against retention of the compulsory license are outlined at pages 66 – 67 of this Committee s 1967 report H Rept No 83 90th Cong 1st Sess The Committee s conclusion on this point remains the same as in 1967 that a compulsory licensing system is still warranted as a condition for the rights of reproducing and distributing phonorecords of copyrighted music but that the present system is unfair and unnecessarily burdensome on copyright owners and that the present statutory rate is too low Availability and Scope of Compulsory License Subsection a of section 115 deals with three doubtful questions under the present law 1 the nature of the original recording that will make the work available to others for recording under a compulsory license 2 the nature of the sound recording that can be made under a compulsory license and 3 the extent to which someone acting under a compulsory license can depart from the work as written or recorded without violating the copyright owner s right to make an arrangement or other derivative work The first two of these questions are answered in clause 1 of section 115 a and the third is the subject of clause 2 The present law though not altogether clear apparently bases compulsory licensing on the making or licensing of the first recording even if no authorized records are distributed to the public The first sentence of section 115 a 1 would change the basis for compulsory licensing to authorized public distribution of phonorecords including disks and audio tapes but not the sound tracks or other sound records accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work Under the clause a compulsory license would be available to anyone as soon as phonorecords of a nondramatic musical work have been distributed to the public in the United States under the authority of the copyright owner The second sentence of clause 1 which has been the subject of some debate provides that a person may obtain a compulsory license only if his or her primary purpose in making phonorecords is to distribute them to the public for private use This provision was criticized as being discriminatory against background music systems since it would prevent a background music producer from making recordings without the express consent of the copyright owner it was argued that this could put the producer at a great competitive disadvantage with performing rights societies allow discrimination and destroy or prevent entry of businesses The committee concluded however that the purpose of the compulsory license does not extend to manufacturers of phonorecords that are intended primarily for commercial use including not only broadcasters and jukebox operators but also background music services The final sentence of clause 1 provides that a person may not obtain a compulsory license for use of the work in the duplication of a sound recording made by another unless the sound recording being duplicated was itself fixed lawfully and the making of phonorecords duplicated from it was authorized by the owner of copyright in the sound recording or if the recording was fixed before February 15 1972 by the voluntary or compulsory licensee of the music used in the recording The basic intent of this sentence is to make clear that a person is not entitled to a compulsory license of copyrighted musical works for the purpose of making an unauthorized duplication of a musical sound recording originally developed and produced by another It is the view of the Committee that such was the original intent of the Congress in enacting the 1909 Copyright Act and it has been so construed by the 3d 5th 9th and 10th Circuits in the following cases Duchess Music Corp v Stern 458 F 2d 1305 9th Cir cert denied 409 U S 847 1972 [ 93 S Ct 52 34 L Ed 2d 88 ] Edward B Marks Music Corp v Colorado Magnetics Inc 497 F 2d 285 aff d on rehearing en banc 497 F 2d 292 10th Cir 1974 cert denied 419 U S 1120 1975 [ 95 S Ct 801 42 L Ed 2d 819 ] Jondora

F 2d 667 5th Cir cert denied 423 U S 841 1975 [ 96 S Ct 73 46 L Ed 2d 61 ] Under this provision it would be possible to obtain a compulsory license for the use of copyrighted music under section 115 if the owner of the sound recording being duplicated authorizes its duplication This does not however in any way require the owner of the original sound recording to grant a license to duplicate the original sound recording It is not intended that copyright protection for sound recordings be circumscribed by requiring the owners of sound recordings to grant a compulsory license to unauthorized duplicators or others The second clause of subsection a is intended to recognize the practical need for a limited privilege to make arrangements of music being used under a compulsory license but without allowing the music to be perverted distorted or travestied Clause 2 permits arrangements of a work to the extent necessary to conform it to the style or manner of interpretation of the performance involved so long as it does not change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work The provision also prohibits the compulsory licensee from claiming an independent copyright in his arrangement as a derivative work without the express consent of the copyright owner Procedure for Obtaining Compulsory License Section 115 b 1 requires anyone who wishes to take advantage of the compulsory licensing provisions to serve a notice of intention to obtain a compulsory license which is much like the notice of intention to use required by the present law Under section 115 the notice must be served before any phonorecords are distributed but service can take place before or within 30 days after making any phonorecords The notice is to be served on the copyright owner but if the owner is not identified in the Copyright Office records it shall be sufficient to file the notice of intention in the Copyright Office The Committee deleted clause 2 of section 115 b of S 22 as adopted by the Senate The provision was a vestige of jukebox provisions in earlier bills and its requirements no longer served any useful purpose Clause 2 [ formerly clause 3 ] of section 115 b [ cl 2 of subsec b of this section ] provides that failure to serve or file the notice required by clause 1 * * * forecloses the possibility of a compulsory license and in the absence of a negotiated license renders the making and distribution of phonorecords actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506 The remedies provided in section 501 are those applicable to infringements generally Royalty Payable Under Compulsory License Identification of Copyright Owner — Under the present law a copyright owner is obliged to file a notice of use in the Copyright Office stating that the initial recording of the copyrighted work has been made or licensed in order to recover against an unauthorized record manufacturer This requirement has resulted in a technical loss of rights in some cases and serves little or no purpose where the registration and assignment records of the Copyright Office already show the facts of ownership Section 115 c 1 therefore drops any formal notice of use requirements and merely provides that to be entitled to receive royalties under a compulsory license the copyright owner must be identified in the registration or other public records of the Copyright Office On the other hand since proper identification is an important precondition of recovery the bill further provides that the owner is entitled to royalties for phonorecords manufactured and distributed after being so identified but is not entitled to recover for any phonorecords previously made and distributed Basis of Royalty — Under the present statute the specified royalty is payable on each such part manufactured regardless of how many parts i e records are sold This basis for calculating the royalty has been revised in section 115 c 2 to provide that the royalty under a compulsory license shall be payable for every phonorecord made and distributed in accordance with the license This basis is more compatible with the general practice in negotiated licenses today It is unjustified to require a compulsory licensee to pay license fees on records which merely go into inventory which may later be destroyed and from which the record producer gains no economic benefit It is intended that the Register of Copyrights will prescribe regulations insuring that copyright owners will receive full and prompt payment for all phonorecords made and distributed Section 115 c 2 states that a phonorecord is considered distributed if the person exercising the compulsory license has voluntarily and permanently parted with its possession For this purpose the concept of distribution comprises any act by which the person exercising the compulsory license voluntarily relinquishes possession of a phonorecord considered as a fungible unit regardless of whether the distribution is to the public passes title constitutes a gift or is sold rented leased or loaned unless it is actually returned and the transaction cancelled Neither involuntary relinquishment as through theft or fire nor the destruction of unwanted records would constitute distribution The term made is intended to be broader than manufactured and to include within its scope every possible manufacturing or other process capable of reproducing a sound recording in phonorecords The use of the phrase made and distributed establishes the basis upon which the royalty rate for compulsory licensing under section 115 is to be calculated but it is in no way intended to weaken the liability of record pressers and other manufacturers and makers of phonorecords for copyright infringement where the compulsory licensing requirements have not been met As under the present law even if a presser manufacturer or other maker had no role in the distribution process that person would be regarded as jointly and severally liable in a case where the court finds that infringement has taken place because of failure to comply with the provisions of section 115 Under existing practices in the record industry phonorecords are distributed to wholesalers and retailers with the privilege of returning unsold copies for credit or exchange As a result the number of recordings that have been permanently distributed will not usually be known until some time — six or seven months on the average — after the initial distribution In recognition of this problem it has become a well established industry practice under negotiated licenses for record companies to maintain reasonable reserves of the mechanical royalties due the copyright owners against which royalties on the returns can be offset The Committee recognizes that this practice may be consistent with the statutory requirements for monthly compulsory license accounting reports but recognizes the possibility that without proper safeguards the maintenance of such reserves could be manipulated to avoid making payments of the full amounts owing to copyright owners Under these circumstances the regulations prescribed by the Register of Copyrights should contain detailed provisions ensuring that the ultimate disposition of every phonorecord made under a compulsory license is accounted for and that payment is made for every phonorecord voluntarily and permanently distributed In particular the Register should prescribe a point in time when for accounting purposes under section 115 a phonorecord will be considered permanently distributed and should prescribe the situations in which a compulsory licensee is barred from maintaining reserves e g situations in which the compulsory licensee has frequently failed to make payments in the past Rate of Royalty — A large preponderance of the extensive testimony presented to the Committee on section 115 was devoted to the question of the amount of the statutory royalty rate An extensive review and analysis of the testimony and arguments received on this question appear in the 1974 Senate report S Rep No 94 – 473 at page 71 – 94 While upon initial review it might be assumed that the rate established in 1909 would not be reasonable at the present time the committee believes that an increase in the mechanical royalty rate must be justified on the basis of existing economic conditions and not on the mere passage of 67 years Following a thorough analysis of the problem the Committee considers that an increase of the present two cent royalty to a rate of 2¾ cents or 6 of one cent per minute or fraction of playing time is justified This rate will be subject to review by the Copyright Royalty Commission as provided by section 801 in 1980 and at 10 year intervals thereafter Accounting and Payment of Royalties Effect of Default Clause 3 of Section 115 c provides that royalty payments are to be made on a monthly basis in accordance with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation In order to increase the protection of copyright proprietors against economic harm from companies which might refuse or fail to pay their just obligations compulsory licensees will also be required to make a detailed cumulative annual statement of account certified by a Certified Public Accountant A source of criticism with respect to the compulsory licensing provisions of the present statute has been the rather ineffective sanctions against default by compulsory licensees Clause 4 of section 115 c corrects this defect by permitting the copyright owner to serve written notice on a defaulting licensee and by providing for termination of the compulsory license if the default is not remedied within 30 days after notice is given Termination under this clause renders either the making or the distribution or both of all phonorecords for which the royalty had not been paid actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506 References in Text The date of enactment

apparent that in one major area the problems are not sufficiently developed for a definitive legislative solution This is the area of computer uses of copyrighted works the use of a work in conjunction with automatic systems capable of storing processing retrieving or transferring information The Commission on New Technological Uses is among other things now engaged in making a thorough study of the emerging patterns in this field and it will on the basis of its findings recommend definitive copyright provisions to deal with the situation Since it would be premature to change existing law on computer uses at present the purpose of section 117 is to preserve the status quo It is intended neither to cut off any rights that may now exist nor to create new rights that might be denied under the Act of 1909 or under common law principles currently applicable The provision deals only with the exclusive rights of a copyright owner with respect to computer uses that is the bundle of rights specified for other types of uses in section 106 and qualified in sections 107 through 116 and 118 With respect to the copyright ability of computer programs the ownership of copyrights in them the term of protection and the formal requirements of the remainder of the bill the new statute would apply Under section 117 an action for infringement of a copyrighted work by means of a computer would necessarily be a federal action brought under the new title 17 The court in deciding the scope of exclusive rights in the computer area would first need to determine the applicable law whether State statutory or common law or the Act of 1909 Having determined what law was applicable its decision would depend upon its interpretation of what that law was on the point on

§ 4 d Oct 6 2006 120 Stat 1482 Historical and Revision Notes house report no 94 – 1476 General Background During its consideration of revision legislation in 1975 the Senate Judiciary Committee adopted an amendment offered by Senator Charles McC Mathias The amendment now section 118 of the Senate bill [ this section ] grants to public broadcasting a compulsory license for use of nondramatic literary and musical works as well as pictorial graphic and sculptural works subject to payment of reasonable royalty fees to be set by the Copyright Royalty Tribunal established by that bill The Mathias amendment requires that public broadcasters at periodic intervals file a notice with the Copyright Office containing information required by the Register of Copyrights and deposit a statement of account and the total royalty fees for the period covered by the statement In July of each year all persons having a claim to such fees are to file their claims with the Register of Copyrights If no controversy exists the Register would distribute the royalties to the various copyright owners and their agents after deducting reasonable administrative costs controversies are to be settled by the Tribunal On July 10 1975 the House Subcommittee heard testimony on the Mathias amendment from representatives of public broadcasters authors publishers and music performing rights societies The public broadcasters pointed to Congressional concern for the development of their activities as evidenced by the Public Broadcasting Act [ 47 U S C 390 et seq ] They urged that a compulsory license was essential to assure public broadcasting broad access to copyrighted materials at reasonable royalties and without administratively cumbersome and costly clearance problems that would impair the vitality of their operations The opponents of the amendment argued that the nature of public broadcasting has changed significantly in the past decade to the extent that it now competes with commercial broadcasting as a national entertainment and cultural medium They asserted that the performing rights society arrangements under which copyrighted music is licensed for performance removed any problem in clearing music for broadcasting and that voluntary agreements could adequately resolve the copyright problems feared by public broadcasters at less expense and burden than the compulsory license for synchronization and literary rights The authors of literary works stressed that a compulsory licensing system would deny them the fundamental right to control the use of their works and protect their reputation in a major communications medium General Policy Considerations The Committee is cognizant of the intent of Congress in enacting the Public Broadcasting Act on November 7 1967 [ 47 U S C 390 et seq ] that encouragement and support of noncommercial broadcasting is in the public interest It is also aware that public broadcasting may encounter problems not confronted by commercial broadcasting enterprises due to such factors as the special nature of programming repeated use of programs and of course limited financial resources Thus the Committee determined that the nature of public broadcasting does warrant special treatment in certain areas However the Committee did not feel that the broad compulsory license provided in the Senate bill is necessary to the continued successful operation of public broadcasting In addition the Committee believes that the system provided in the Senate bill for the deposit of royalty fees with the Copyright Office for distribution to claimants and the resolution of disputes over such distribution by a statutory tribunal can be replaced by payments directly between the parties without the intervention of government machinery and its attendant administrative costs In general the Committee amended the public broadcasting provisions of the Senate bill toward attainment of the objective clearly stated in the Report of the Senate Judiciary Committee namely that copyright owners and public broadcasters be encouraged to reach voluntary private agreements Procedures Not later than thirty days following the publication by the President of the notice announcing the initial appointments to the Copyright Royalty Commission specified in Chapter 8 [§ 801 et seq of this title ] the Chairman of the Commission is to publish notice in the Federal Register of the initiation of proceedings to determine reasonable terms and rates for certain uses of published nondramatic musical works and published pictorial graphic and sculptural works during a period ending on December 31 1982 Copyright owners and public broadcasting entities that do not reach voluntary agreement are bound by the terms and rates established by the Commission which are to be published in the Federal Register within six months of the notice of initiation of proceedings During the period between the effective date of the Act [ Jan 1 1978 ] and the publication of the rates and terms the Committee has preserved the status quo by providing in section 118 b 4 that the Act does not afford to copyright owners or public broadcasting entities any greater or lesser rights with respect to the relevant uses of nondramatic musical works and pictorial graphic and sculptural works than those afforded under the law in effect on December 31 1977 License agreements that have been voluntarily negotiated supersede as between the parties to the agreement the terms and rates established by the Commission provided that copies of the agreements are properly filed with the Copyright Office within 30 days of execution Under clause 2 of section 118 b the agreements may be negotiated at any time — whether before during or after determinations by the Commission Under section 118 c the procedures for the Commission s establishing such rates and terms are to be repeated in the last half of 1982 and every five years thereafter Establishment of Reasonable Terms and Rates In establishing reasonable terms and rates for public broadcasting use of the specified works the Commission under clause b 1 of section 118 is to consider proposals timely submitted to it as well as any other relevant information including that put forward for its consideration by any interested party The Committee does not intend that owners of copyrighted material be required to subsidize public broadcasting It is intended that the Commission assure a fair return to copyright owners without unfairly burdening public broadcasters Section 118 b 3 provides that the Commission may consider the rates for comparable circumstances under voluntary license agreements The Commission is also expected to consider both the general public interest in encouraging the growth and development of public broadcasting and the promotion of science and the useful arts through the encouragement of musical and artistic creation The Committee anticipates that the terms established by the Commission shall include provisions as to acceptable methods of payment of royalties by public broadcasting entities to copyright owners For example where the whereabouts of the copyright owner may not be readily known the terms should specify the nature of the obligation of the public broadcasting entity to locate the owner or to set aside or otherwise assure payment of appropriate royalties should he or she appear and make a claim Section 118 b 3 requires the Commission to establish requirements by which copyright owners may receive reasonable notice of the use of their works The Committee intends that these requirements shall not impose undue hardships on public broadcasting entities and in the above illustration shall provide for the specific termination of any period during which the public broadcasting entity is required to set aside payments It is expected that in some cases especially in the area of pictorial graphic and sculptural works the whereabouts of the owners of copyright may not be known and they may never appear to claim payment of royalties The Commission is also to establish record keeping requirements for public broadcasting entities in order to facilitate the identification calculation allocation and payment of claims and royalties Works Affected Under sections 118 b and e of the Committee s amendment the establishment of rates and terms by the Copyright Royalty Commission pertains only to the use of published nondramatic musical works and published pictorial graphic and sculptural works As under the Senate bill rights in plays operas ballet and other stage presentations motion pictures and other audiovisual works are not affected Section 118 f is intended to make clear that this section does not permit unauthorized use beyond the limits of section 107 of individual frames from a filmstrip or any other portion of any audiovisual work Additionally the application of this section to pictorial graphic and sculptural works does not extend to the production of transmission programs drawn to any substantial extent from a compilation of such works The Committee also concluded that the performance of nondramatic literary works should not be subject to Commission determination It was particularly concerned that a compulsory license for literary works would result in loss of control by authors over the use of their work in violation of basic principles of artistic and creative freedom It is recognized that copyright not only provides compensation to authors but also protection as to how and where their works are used The Committee was assured by representatives of authors and publishers that licensing arrangements for readings from their books poems and other works on public broadcasting programs for reasonable compensation and under reasonable safeguards for authors rights could be worked out in private negotiation The Committee strongly urges the parties to work toward mutually acceptable licenses to facilitate their negotiations and aid in the possible establishment of clearance mechanisms and rates the Committee s amendment provides the parties in section 118 e 1 with an appropriately limited exemption from the antitrust laws [ 15 U S C 1 et seq ] The Committee has also provided in paragraph 2 of clause e that on January 3 1980 the Register of Copyrights after consultation with the interested parties shall submit a report to Congress on the extent to which voluntary licensing arrangements have been reached with respect to public broadcast use of nondramatic literary works and present legislative or other recommendations if warranted The use of copyrighted sound recordings in educational television and radio programs distributed by or through public broadcasting entities is governed by section 114 and is discussed in connection with that section Activities Affected Section 118 d specifies the activities which may be engaged in by public broadcasting entities under terms and rates established by the Commission These include the performance or display of published nondramatic musical works and of published pictorial graphic and sculptural works in the course of transmissions by noncommercial educational broadcast stations and the production reproduction and distribution of transmission programs including such works by nonprofit organizations for the purpose of such transmissions It is the intent of the Committee that interconnection activities serving as a technical adjunct to such transmissions such as the use of satellites or microwave equipment be included within the specified activities Paragraph 3 of clause d also includes the reproduction simultaneously with transmission of public broadcasting programs by governmental bodies or nonprofit institutions and the performance or display of the contents of the reproduction under the conditions of section 110 1 However the reproduction so made must be destroyed at the end of seven days from the transmission This limited provision for unauthorized simultaneous or off the air reproduction is limited to nondramatic musical works and pictorial graphic and sculptural works included in public broadcasting transmissions It does not extend to other works included in the transmissions or to the entire transmission program It is the intent of the Committee that schools be permitted to engage in off the air reproduction to the extent and under the conditions provided in [ section ] 118 d 3 however in the event a public broadcasting station or producer makes the reproduction and distributes a copy to the school the station or producer will not be held liable for the school s failure to destroy the reproduction provided it has given notice of the requirement of destruction In such a case the school itself although it did not engage in the act of reproduction is deemed an infringer fully subject to the remedies provided in Chapter 5 of the Act [§ 501 et seq of this title ] The establishment of standards for adequate notice under this provision should be considered by the Commission Section 118 f makes it clear that the rights of performance and other activities specified in subsection d do not extend to the unauthorized dramatization of a nondramatic musical work References in Text Subsection d referred to in subsec a was
